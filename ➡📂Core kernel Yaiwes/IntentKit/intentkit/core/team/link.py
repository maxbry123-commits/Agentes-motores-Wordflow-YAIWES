"""Team links: link external app accounts (Composio) and expose their tools.

Flow, mirroring the channel OAuth installs in ``core/team/oauth.py``:

1. A member picks a whitelisted app on the Links page; ``initiate_team_link``
   asks Composio for a hosted auth link and records a *pending* link row keyed
   by the Composio connected-account id.
2. The browser follows the redirect URL; Composio runs the provider OAuth and
   sends the browser back to the SPA's ``/oauth/callback`` page with
   ``connected_account_id`` (+ ``status``) query params.
3. The SPA relays the id to the authenticated complete endpoint;
   ``complete_team_link`` authorizes the caller, verifies the account is
   ACTIVE **at Composio** (query params are never trusted), and activates the
   row.

Levels: team-level apps are linked/unlinked by team admins and shared with
every member; user-level apps are linked by each member for themselves, and
only the owning user (or an admin) may unlink them. Either way, all accounts
live under the team's single Composio user (``team-{team_id}``) — the level
is an IntentKit concept, enforced here and by session pinning.

SECURITY: the pending row is the CSRF / session-binding guard — the
connected-account id routes the callback to its team, and completion requires
the caller to be the user who initiated the link (like the signed ``state``
in the channel OAuth flow), holding the role its level demands.

Active links are exposed to the team's lead agent as MCP tools: a fresh
Composio Tool Router session is created per executor build (executors are
cached ~1h per team+user and invalidated on link changes), pinned to exactly
the team-level accounts plus the current user's own user-level accounts, and
its hosted MCP endpoint provides the ``COMPOSIO_*`` tools.
