# JeevesAgent — release helper.
#
# Daily commits / pushes are plain git. This Makefile only adds a
# `release` target — the explicit "publish to PyPI" flag.
#
# Usage:
#   make release BUMP=patch    # X.Y.Z[.devN]  → X.Y.(Z+1)
#   make release BUMP=minor    # X.Y.Z[.devN]  → X.(Y+1).0
#   make release BUMP=major    # X.Y.Z[.devN]  → (X+1).0.0
#   make release BUMP=dev_n    # X.Y.Z.devN    → X.Y.Z.dev(N+1)
#
# Important: standard semver bumps drop the .devN marker. So the
# very first release of an in-development branch (e.g. shipping
# the work currently sitting at 0.3.0.dev0 as 0.3.0) is a manual
# pyproject edit + tag — see `make first-release` below.
#
# What it does:
#   1. Refuses to run with a dirty working tree.
#   2. bump-my-version edits pyproject.toml + loomflow/__init__.py
#      atomically, commits, and tags v<new_version>.
#   3. Pushes the commit and the tag to origin.
#   4. The push of the v* tag fires .github/workflows/release.yml,
#      which builds and uploads to PyPI via trusted publishing.
#
# Prerequisites: bump-my-version (in the [dev] extras —
# `pip install -e '.[dev]'`).
