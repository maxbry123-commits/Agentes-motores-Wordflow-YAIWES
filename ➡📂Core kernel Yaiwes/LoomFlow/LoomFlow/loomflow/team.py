"""Team — sibling-style builders for multi-agent architectures.

Coming from LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, or the OpenAI Agents SDK,
you'd expect to construct a multi-agent team like this::

    team = create_supervisor([researcher, writer], model="gpt-4")
    result = await team.invoke(...)

In Loom the same shape is :class:`Team`::

    team = Team.supervisor(
        workers={"researcher": researcher, "writer": writer},
        instructions="manage the pipeline",
        model="gpt-4.1-mini",
    )
    result = await team.run("write me a blog post")

Under the hood :class:`Team` returns a regular :class:`Agent` —
exactly what ``Agent(architecture=Supervisor(...))`` would produce.
The two shapes are interchangeable; :class:`Team` is the
"familiar-from-other-frameworks" facade for the common case, while
the nested ``Agent(architecture=...)`` form remains the path for
**recursive composition** (wrapping a Supervisor in Reflexion, etc.).

Provided builders
-----------------

* :meth:`Team.supervisor` — coordinator + workers
* :meth:`Team.swarm` — peer agents handing off control
* :meth:`Team.router` — classify-and-dispatch
* :meth:`Team.debate` — N debaters + optional judge
* :meth:`Team.actor_critic` — actor + critic pair
* :meth:`Team.blackboard` — shared workspace + coordinator

Each method exposes **every** :class:`Agent` constructor kwarg
explicitly (rather than forwarding through ``**kwargs``) so that
IDEs and type-checkers surface the full parameter list with proper
types, defaults, and docstrings on hover.

Standalone-run helper
---------------------

:func:`run_architecture` builds a minimal :class:`Agent` shell
around any :class:`Architecture` instance and runs it. Useful for
**testing orchestrators in isolation** without wiring a full Agent
yourself::

    sup = Supervisor(workers={"a": agent_a})
    result = await run_architecture(sup, "do the thing", model="gpt-4.1-mini")

        to the same specialist reuse memory (the typical case in a
        long REPL: route to ``billing`` once, route to ``billing``
        again — the second call sees the first conversation).

        ``conversation_scope`` controls whether routes share message
        history with each other:

        * ``"per_route"`` (default, back-compat) — every route runs
          under its own derived session_id
          (``{parent}__route_{name}``). Right primitive for fan-out
          routing where routes are isolated worlds (multilingual,
          security domains, A/B experiments).

        * ``"shared"`` — every route runs under the PARENT
          session_id. All turns contribute to ONE conversation
          regardless of which route handled each. Right primitive
          for chat frontends where routes are an implementation
          detail (e.g. a SIMPLE-vs-COMPLEX classifier) and the user
          expects continuity across turns. In shared mode,
          persistent-subagent session_ids are bypassed so all
          rehydration keys off the parent session.

        ``prompt_caching=`` enables provider-native caching on the
        classifier-coordinator (see :meth:`Team.supervisor` for
        accepted shapes). Specialists cache via their own ``Agent``.
