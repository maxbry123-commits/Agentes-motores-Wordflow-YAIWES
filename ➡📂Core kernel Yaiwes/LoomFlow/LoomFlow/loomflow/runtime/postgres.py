"""Convenience: ``JournaledRuntime`` rooted at a Postgres pool.

Usage::

    runtime = await PostgresRuntime.connect("postgres://localhost/jeeves")
    await runtime.init_schema()
    agent = Agent("...", model="claude-opus-4-7", runtime=runtime)

The journal lives in two Postgres tables (``journal_steps`` and
``journal_streams``) which :meth:`init_schema` creates idempotently.
Same protocol as :class:`SqliteRuntime`; production-grade durability
when paired with a managed Postgres instance.
