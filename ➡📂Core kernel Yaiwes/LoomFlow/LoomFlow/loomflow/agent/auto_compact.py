"""Auto-compact — summarise old turns when conversation grows large.

The third tier of context-budget defence, paired with snip (0.10.16,
cheap pure-slicing) and tool_result_summarizer (0.10.14, per-result
compression). Auto-compact is the heavy-hitter: when ``session.messages``
crosses a token threshold, it fires an LLM call to summarise the older
half of the conversation into a single ``system`` message, keeping the
last N turn groups verbatim.

Where it fires
--------------

Inside :meth:`Agent._loop`, after every ``architecture.run()`` pass —
the first pass of a default (no-stop-hook) agent included, so opting
into ``auto_compact_at_tokens=`` works without also registering stop
hooks. After each pass we count tokens in ``session.messages`` via
the 0.10.17 token-counting helper. If the count exceeds
``auto_compact_at_tokens``, we compact in place: the older messages
are replaced with a single summary system message, the most recent N
user-anchored turn groups stay verbatim.

Why not fire BEFORE the first architecture pass? Because at that
point ``session.messages`` is fresh (or rehydrated from memory — and
there snip + memory's own limits are the right defence). Auto-
compact's job is "the conversation grew while running, prune it
before the next model call" — that moment is after a pass finishes.

What survives the compact
-------------------------

* The leading ``Role.SYSTEM`` head — always (identity / instructions).
* A NEW ``Role.SYSTEM`` message containing the summary of dropped
  content — prefixed with ``[auto-compacted summary]`` so the model
  knows what it's reading.
* The last N user-anchored turn groups — verbatim, so the model has
  recent concrete context (the most recent tool result is usually
  load-bearing for the next decision).

Where the summary lives
-----------------------

In-conversation as a new system message — NOT written to long-term
memory. Auto-compact is per-run; the framework doesn't assume a
``session_summary`` working-block convention exists (loom-code's
``compact.py`` writes to ``session_summary`` via memory.update_block
for its own purposes, but that's an app-level choice, not a
framework one).

Failure semantics
-----------------

If the summariser raises or returns an empty string, auto-compact is
a no-op for this iteration — the conversation continues uncompacted.
Same principle as :mod:`loomflow.tools.result_summarizer`: framework-
level token optimisations must NEVER kill a turn.
