"""Architecture protocol + supporting types.

Three pieces:

* :class:`AgentSession` — mutable per-run state shared between
  :class:`Agent` and the :class:`Architecture`. The architecture
  reads ``messages`` and writes ``turns``, ``output``,
  ``cumulative_usage``, ``interrupted``, ``interruption_reason``,
  and ``metadata`` as iteration progresses. The :class:`Agent` reads
  the final state to build a :class:`RunResult`.

* :class:`Dependencies` — every protocol implementation an
  architecture might need (model, memory, runtime, tools, budget,
  permissions, hooks, telemetry, audit log, ``max_turns``), bundled
  into one struct so an architecture's ``run()`` signature stays
  short. Stable for the lifetime of a run.

* :class:`Architecture` — the protocol architectures implement. One
  method (``run``) plus a ``name`` and ``declared_workers`` for
  introspection.

Setup events (``Event.started``) and teardown events
(``Event.completed``) are emitted by :class:`Agent`, NOT the
architecture. Architectures yield the events that happen *during*
iteration: per-turn, per-tool, per-step, budget warnings, errors.

This keeps every architecture's ``run()`` focused on its own
strategy without re-implementing setup/teardown plumbing.

class ApprovalDecision:
    """Rich outcome of an approval handler (G8 HITL).

    ``bool`` returns stay fully supported — ``True`` means allow,
    ``False`` means deny — so pre-G8 handlers keep working. Return an
    :class:`ApprovalDecision` when you need more than allow/deny:

    * ``"allow"`` / ``"deny"`` — same as ``True`` / ``False``, but with
      an optional ``reason`` surfaced in the deny message + audit log.
    * ``"edit"`` — run the tool with ``edited_args`` instead of the
      model-planned args. The framework swaps the args (a copy of the
      original :class:`ToolCall` — the model's transcript is not
      rewritten) and proceeds as allowed; the tool host re-validates
      the edited args at execute time exactly as it would the
      originals. When ``edited_args`` is ``None``, the original args
      are kept (plain allow).
    * ``"remember_allow"`` / ``"remember_deny"`` — decide AND cache the
      decision for ``(user_id, tool_name)`` for the remainder of this
      run. Subsequent ``ask`` gates for the same user + tool are
      resolved from the cache without re-invoking the handler. The
      cache is session-scoped (``Dependencies.approval_memory``,
      re-initialised per run) and never persisted.

    A raising handler is still fail-closed: the pending call is denied.

    **Interrupt / park pattern.** Approval handlers are async and the
    runtime signal channel is public, so a handler can park the run
    until an out-of-band decision arrives — no framework support
    needed beyond the signal API::

        async def approve(call: ToolCall, user_id: str | None):
            await notify_slack(call, user_id)          # out-of-band ask

            #                      {"action": "allow"})
            return ApprovalDecision(action=payload["action"])
