"""Reflexion: verbal reinforcement learning via memory.

Shinn et al. 2023 — `Reflexion: Language Agents with Verbal
Reinforcement Learning <https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366>`_. After
each attempt, an evaluator scores the output. Below threshold, a
reflector produces a single-sentence "lesson" — written advice the
agent can read on its next attempt.

Lesson storage modes
--------------------

Two storage modes for the persisted lessons:

* **Monotonic block (legacy default).** Every lesson is appended
  to ``memory.<lessons_block_name>`` and shown to the agent on
  every subsequent attempt. Simple but bloats context as lessons
  accumulate.
* **Selective recall (recommended).** Pass ``lesson_store=`` a
  :class:`VectorStore`. Lessons are stored as embedded chunks;
  before each attempt, only the **top-k most relevant lessons**
  for the current task are retrieved and surfaced. Avoids
  context bloat and keeps tutorial advice scoped to where it
  applies. Pair with :class:`InMemoryVectorStore` for in-process,
  or :class:`PostgresVectorStore` for cross-session learning.

Pattern
-------

For each attempt up to ``max_attempts``:

1. **Recall** (selective-recall mode only): query ``lesson_store``
   with the current prompt; write the top-k results into the
   working memory block for this attempt.
2. **Run base architecture** (default
   :class:`~loomflow.architecture.ReAct`).
3. **Evaluate.** A text-only model call scores the output (0-1).
4. **Threshold check.** If ``score >= threshold``, terminate.
5. **Max-attempts check.** If we've hit the cap, terminate.
6. **Reflect.** A text-only model call produces a single sentence
   identifying what went wrong.
7. **Persist.** Append (legacy) or add to ``lesson_store``
   (selective-recall) — keyed by the failing prompt so future
   recall can find it.
8. **Reset.** Clear ``session.messages`` so the base re-seeds its
   context. Cumulative usage carries across attempts. The TURN
   COUNTER does not: each attempt gets a fresh per-attempt turn
   budget (``session.turns`` is reset to 0 before the base runs),
   because the base architecture terminates at ``max_turns`` —
   carrying the count across attempts would starve attempt 2+ down
   to a couple of turns. The cumulative total across all attempts
   is restored onto ``session.turns`` when the run finishes, so
   ``RunResult.turns`` still reports the true overall count.

Strengths
---------
* **Cross-session learning** when paired with a persistent
  memory backend (legacy) or a persistent vector store
  (selective recall).
* **Wraps any base** that reads ``memory.working()``.
* **Cheap**: 1 evaluator + 1 reflector call per failed attempt.

Weaknesses
----------
* **Same-model evaluation.** Self-grading is biased; the score
  may not match human judgment.
* **Score parsing is best-effort.** Falls back to 0.0 on parse
  failure (treated as a failed attempt).
