"""Multi-Agent Debate: N debaters argue, judge synthesizes.

Du et al. 2023 — `Improving Factuality and Reasoning in Language
Models through Multiagent Debate <https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14325>`_.
Liang et al. 2023 (divergent thinking via debate). Production
patterns in AutoGen GroupChat, CAMEL.

Reserve for **high-stakes contested questions where a wrong answer
is expensive**. The 2026 production literature is cautious — debate
adds 3-5× cost over single-agent and works best on a narrow set of
decision-style questions where blind-spot triangulation matters.

Pattern
-------

1. **Round 0 (independent).** All debaters answer the original
   question simultaneously, with no awareness of each other. Run
   in parallel.
2. **Rounds 1..K (debate).** Each debater receives the original
   question + the full transcript so far. They defend or update
   their position. All debaters in a round run in parallel.
3. **Optional convergence check.** If all debaters in a round
   produce exactly-matching answers (after whitespace normalize),
   terminate early. Defaults on; disable for adversarial-only
   debates where you want full rounds.
4. **Judge synthesis.** A separate ``judge`` :class:`Agent`
   receives the full transcript and produces the final answer.
   ``judge=None`` falls back to majority vote (modal answer
   across the final round; tie-broken by first appearance).

Deterministic session ids
-------------------------
Each debater invocation uses
``{parent}__debater_<i>_round_<r>``; the judge uses
``{parent}__judge``. Replays of the parent journal cache the
sub-results and don't re-execute debaters.

Strengths
---------
* **Surfaces blind spots through disagreement** — different priors
  produce different errors; debate transcribes them.
* **Strong on factuality.** TruthfulQA improvement over single-agent
  is well-documented (Du et al. 2023, +12% on 3 debaters / 2 rounds).
* **Heterogeneous-model friendly.** Use Claude + GPT + Llama for
  genuine prior diversity rather than 3× of the same model.

Weaknesses
----------
* **3-5× cost.** N debaters × K rounds + judge. Real money.
* **Sequential rounds.** Even with parallel debaters per round, you
  still wait round-by-round.
* **Groupthink risk.** Same model → same priors → no real
  disagreement. Differentiate models or personas.
* **Judge quality is critical.** Bad judge = bad final answer.
