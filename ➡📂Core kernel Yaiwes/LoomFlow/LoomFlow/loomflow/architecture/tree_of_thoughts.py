"""Tree of Thoughts: branching exploration with per-node evaluation.

Yao et al. 2023 — `Tree of Thoughts: Deliberate Problem Solving with
Large Language Models <https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601>`_. Useful
for combinatorial reasoning, multi-step planning, math (Game of 24),
puzzle solving — anywhere a single straight-shot ReAct trajectory
would commit too early.

Pattern (BFS beam search)
-------------------------

1. **Root** is the problem statement.
2. **For each level up to ``max_depth``:**

   a. **Expand:** for every frontier node, the proposer generates
      ``branch_factor`` candidate "thoughts" (next steps toward a
      solution).
   b. **Evaluate:** the evaluator scores each candidate 0-1 (how
      promising is this branch?).
   c. **Prune:** keep only the top ``beam_width`` scored
      candidates as the next frontier.
   d. **Early exit:** if any candidate scores ``>= solved_threshold``,
      we stop early and use that branch.

3. **Best leaf wins, then synthesis.** The highest-scoring leaf
   across the whole tree selects the winning root→leaf reasoning
   chain; a closing model call (``synthesize_final=True``, the
   default) turns that chain into the actual final answer written
   to ``session.output``. With ``synthesize_final=False`` the raw
   winning thought is the output (legacy behaviour).

This is the "BFS-with-beam" variant — DFS with backtracking is a
follow-up. For a structured combinatorial task, BFS-beam covers most
of what users need.

Cost
----
Per level: ONE batched proposer call per frontier node (asking for
``branch_factor`` numbered thoughts at once) + one evaluator call
per candidate — ``beam_width × (1 + branch_factor) × max_depth``
model calls, plus one closing synthesis call (``synthesize_final``,
on by default). With defaults ``(3, 2, 3)`` that's ~25 calls.
Reserve ToT for problems where the search structure earns the cost
— math/planning tasks where ReAct visibly meanders.

Strengths
---------
* **Explicit search tree.** Every candidate, score, and decision is
  observable through ``architecture_event`` events.
* **Composable.** Wrap inside :class:`Reflexion` to learn which
  evaluation patterns predict real success.
* **Replay-correct.** Each proposer / evaluator call is a named
  ``runtime.step``, so journaled runtimes replay deterministically.

Weaknesses
----------
* **Expensive.** 30-50× a single ReAct turn for typical settings.
* **Evaluator-quality bound.** A weak evaluator picks weak branches
  and the search wastes budget on dead ends.
* **Domain-specific.** Branch-and-evaluate makes sense for
  combinatorial problems; for open-ended writing tasks, use
  Self-Refine or Actor-Critic.
