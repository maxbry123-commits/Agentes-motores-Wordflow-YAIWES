"""Value types for the shared-notebook workspace.

Three Pydantic models flow through the workspace surface:

* :class:`Note` — one entry in the notebook with author, slug,
  title, body, kind, timestamps, and free-form tags.
* :class:`NoteSummary` — the cheap projection of a :class:`Note`
  used in index views; carries only the metadata + one-line lede.
* :class:`NoteMatch` — a search result wrapping a
  :class:`NoteSummary` with a relevance score and a snippet.

Notes carry YAML frontmatter on disk; the workspace serialises /
parses it transparently. Agents never see frontmatter directly —
they get :class:`Note` / :class:`NoteSummary` objects (or rendered
markdown) through the tool surface.
