"""Built-in tools for filesystem + shell agents.

Four tools that any :class:`~loomflow.Agent` can register to
gain the canonical "Claude-Code-shaped" capability set:

* :func:`read_tool` — read a text file
* :func:`write_tool` — create or overwrite a file
* :func:`edit_tool` — find-and-replace inside an existing file
* :func:`bash_tool` — run a shell command, capture output

All four are **factory functions**: they take a ``workdir`` (and
in the case of ``bash_tool`` a few safety knobs) and return a
ready-to-register :class:`Tool` instance. The closure captures the
workdir, so the resulting tool is workdir-scoped — the model can't
escape it via ``../`` traversal or absolute paths.

Usage::

    from loomflow import (
        Agent, read_tool, write_tool, edit_tool, bash_tool,
    )

    agent = Agent(
        "You are a research agent.",
        model="gpt-4.1-mini",
        tools=[
            read_tool(workdir="/tmp/agent_work"),
            write_tool(workdir="/tmp/agent_work"),
            edit_tool(workdir="/tmp/agent_work"),
            bash_tool(workdir="/tmp/agent_work", timeout=30.0),
        ],
    )

Or as a bundle::

    from loomflow import filesystem_tools, bash_tool

    agent = Agent(
        "...",
        model="...",
        tools=filesystem_tools("/tmp/agent_work") + [bash_tool("/tmp/agent_work")],
    )

Safety
------

* **Workdir-scoped by default.** Read / write / edit refuse paths
  that resolve outside the workdir. ``bash_tool`` runs commands
  with the workdir as ``cwd``.
* **Timeout on bash.** Default 30 seconds; override via the
  ``timeout`` kwarg. Commands that exceed the timeout are killed.
* **Minimal environment on bash.** Subprocesses see only a small
  allowlist of environment variables (PATH, HOME, LANG, ...) by
  default — host secrets (API keys, tokens) are NOT handed to
  model-authored commands. Opt in via ``env_allowlist`` /
  ``inherit_env`` / ``extra_env``.
* **Destructive-command denylist (advisory only).** ``bash_tool``
  rejects a small set of obviously-dangerous patterns
  (``rm -rf /``, ``sudo``, ``mkfs``, etc.) by default. This is
  defense-in-depth against accidents, NOT a security boundary —
  see the note on ``_DEFAULT_DENY_PATTERNS``. Use
  :class:`~loomflow.security.sandbox.OSSandbox` for real isolation.
* **Edit requires unique match.** ``edit_tool``'s ``old_string``
  must appear EXACTLY once in the file (unless ``replace_all=True``
  is passed in the call) — forces the model to provide enough
  context for unambiguous edits, the same approach Claude Code
  takes.

These will be the foundation of the upcoming Deep Agent architecture
(planner + filesystem state + subagent registry).

      (:class:`~loomflow.security.sandbox.OSSandbox`).
    * The subprocess environment is a minimal allowlist (PATH,
      HOME, LANG, TERM, TMPDIR, ...) — NOT the full parent
      environment, so host secrets (API keys, tokens) are not
      handed to model-authored commands. See ``env_allowlist`` /
      ``inherit_env`` below to opt in to more.
    * Commands run with a default ``timeout`` of 30 seconds; the
      subprocess is killed on timeout.
    * The shell is invoked via ``/bin/sh -c <command>`` on POSIX
      (macOS, Linux) and ``cmd.exe /c <command>`` on Windows. The
      command STRING is what the model emits — it must use the
      shell's native syntax for whichever host runs it. ``ls``
      and ``rm`` won't work in cmd.exe; ``dir`` and ``del`` won't
      work in sh. Surface the host platform to the model in the
      system prompt if you need cross-host commands.

    Knobs:

    * ``allow_pattern`` — a callable that takes the command string
      and returns True if the command should run. When provided, it
      OVERRIDES the default deny list — you take full responsibility.
    * ``env_allowlist`` — replace the default allowlist with your
      own set of parent-env variable names to forward (e.g.
      ``[*_DEFAULT_ENV_ALLOWLIST, "VIRTUAL_ENV", "CARGO_HOME"]``).
    * ``inherit_env`` — ``True`` forwards the ENTIRE parent
      environment (pre-fix behaviour). Opt-in only: this hands
      every host secret to the commands the model writes.
    * ``extra_env`` — extra environment variables merged into the
      subprocess env (applied last, on top of whichever base the
      two knobs above produced).
    * ``timeout`` — seconds before the command is killed.
    * ``executor`` — a :class:`~loomflow.tools.executor.CodeExecutor`
      to route execution through (Docker / remote sandbox adapters,
      or :class:`~loomflow.tools.executor.SubprocessExecutor`).
      Deny-pattern checks, the timeout, the computed env, and output
      caps/formatting all still apply — only the process-spawning is
      delegated. NOTE: the executor decides the working directory;
      pass ``SubprocessExecutor(cwd=<same workdir>)`` to preserve
      this tool's workdir-cwd semantics (remote executors have their
      own filesystem). Default ``None`` = run on the host directly.

    ``workdir`` is optional; ``None`` uses the framework's default
    tempdir (shared with the other built-in tools).
