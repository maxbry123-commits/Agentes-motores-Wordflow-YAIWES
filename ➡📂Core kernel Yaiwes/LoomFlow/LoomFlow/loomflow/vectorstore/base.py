"""VectorStore protocol + shared types and helpers.

Every concrete vector store implements the :class:`VectorStore`
protocol — a small async surface (add / delete / search /
search_by_vector / count / get_by_ids). Backends differ in storage
and ANN algorithm, but the interface is identical so swapping
``InMemoryVectorStore`` for ``ChromaVectorStore`` / etc. is a
one-line change.

# Filtering

The ``filter`` argument to :meth:`search` is a Mongo-style query
expression — see :mod:`loomflow.vectorstore._filter` for the
operator reference. Common shapes::

    {"source": "report.pdf"}                 # equality shorthand
    {"page": {"$gte": 5}}                    # range
    {"tag": {"$in": ["draft", "final"]}}     # membership
    {"$and": [{"a": 1}, {"b": 2}]}           # composition

# Diversity (MMR)

:meth:`search` accepts ``diversity: float | None`` in [0, 1] for
Maximal Marginal Relevance reranking. ``None`` (default) gives
plain top-k by similarity. ``0.0`` is identical to ``None``;
``1.0`` is maximum diversity. Most users want ``0.3``..``0.5``
when they want diversity at all.

We picked the 0..1 diversity scale (rather than LangChain's
inverted ``lambda_mult``) because "more diverse → bigger number"
is intuitive and "fully relevant" is the natural zero state.

          InMemory, so a rerank/fusion pipeline can mix backends.

          (``$eq`` / ``$in`` / ``$gt`` / ``$and`` / ``$exists`` …).
          Chroma and Postgres push it into the engine (always returns
          ``k`` if ``k`` match). FAISS and InMemory POST-filter an
          over-fetched candidate pool, so a very tight filter on a
          large store may return FEWER than ``k`` even when more
          matches exist — best-effort, not guaranteed-``k``. Prefer
          Chroma/Postgres when an exact-``k`` filtered result matters.
