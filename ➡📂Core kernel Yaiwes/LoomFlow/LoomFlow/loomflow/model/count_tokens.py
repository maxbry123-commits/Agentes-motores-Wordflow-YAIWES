"""Token counting — provider-native → tiktoken → char-based fallback.

The foundation 0.10.19's auto-compact will build on. Today's
visible use case: ``/cost``-style UIs that want to show
"how close are we to the context window?" without making an
extra round-trip just to find out.

Design: a single top-level :func:`count_tokens` helper that
takes a :class:`~loomflow.core.protocols.Model` and a list of
:class:`Message`. Three-tier fallback chain:

1. **Provider-native.** If the model adapter has a
   ``count_tokens(messages, tools=)`` method (Anthropic's
   ``client.messages.count_tokens(...)``, OpenAI's tiktoken
   wrapping, etc.) we use it — exact byte-accurate counts.

2. **tiktoken.** If tiktoken is installed (it is under the
   ``loader`` extra), we tokenize via ``cl100k_base`` — the
   encoding GPT-4-class and Claude-3+ models use, accurate
   enough for budgeting decisions. Same encoding both major
   providers' tokenizers approximate, so the answer is the
   right order of magnitude regardless of which provider runs
   the actual completion.

3. **Char-based estimate.** Last resort, no deps. ``len(text)
   // 4`` is the rule-of-thumb token count for English-ish
   prose; we use it when both upstream tiers fail (or when the
   user runs without the ``loader`` extra). Always returns
   something — counts are foundational; raising would propagate
   into compact/snip decision sites that have no graceful fall-
   back.

The Model protocol is NOT modified. ``count_tokens`` on adapters
is duck-typed via ``hasattr`` — old custom Model impls that
don't implement it inherit the fallback automatically.

Tools are included in the estimate: serialised ``ToolDef``
JSON-schema bytes count toward the prompt under both Anthropic
and OpenAI tokenizers, so omitting them would systematically
under-count by 200-1000 tokens for tool-heavy agents.
