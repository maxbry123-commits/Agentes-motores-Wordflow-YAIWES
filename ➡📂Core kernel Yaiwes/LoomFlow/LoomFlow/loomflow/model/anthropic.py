"""Adapter for Anthropic's Claude models via the official ``anthropic`` SDK.

Streams via ``messages.stream``; normalises Anthropic's event types into
our :class:`ModelChunk` shape:

* ``text_delta`` -> ``ModelChunk(kind="text", text=...)``
* ``thinking_delta`` -> ``ModelChunk(kind="thinking", text=...)``;
  the full thinking block (content + signature) is captured so it
  can be replayed on the next assistant turn (extended thinking +
  tool use requires signed thinking blocks to round-trip)
* ``input_json_delta`` accumulates partial tool-use JSON; on
  ``content_block_stop`` we emit ``ModelChunk(kind="tool_call", ...)``
* ``message_delta`` carries the final ``stop_reason`` and output token
  count; ``message_start`` carries the input token count
* a single trailing ``ModelChunk(kind="finish", ...)`` is emitted when
  the stream ends, regardless of whether tools were called

The SDK is imported lazily inside ``__init__`` so users can
``from loomflow.model import AnthropicModel`` without the
``anthropic`` extra installed; the import only fires when the
constructor needs to build a default client.

    Anthropic accepts **up to four** ``cache_control`` markers per
    request, each creating an independent cache entry (the longest
    matching prefix wins on read). We use them like this:

    1. The LAST content block of the FINAL message — caches the
       whole conversation prefix, so multi-turn agent loops re-read
       the growing history at the 0.1x cache rate instead of paying
       the full input rate on every turn (quadratic cost otherwise).
    2. The LAST tool definition — caches the entire tool array.
    3. The LAST *system content block* — caches the full system
       prompt (catches turns where recall is empty / unchanged).
    4. One earlier system block, working backward — caches a stable
       prefix (instructions / memory) independently of any
       per-turn-volatile recall block that sits later.

    Budget accounting: 1 breakpoint is reserved for the message
    tail whenever ``messages`` is supplied and 1 for tools whenever
    any exist; system blocks get the remainder (never more than 3).

    Anthropic requires ``system`` as a top-level field and structures

    Returns ``system_parts`` as a list (one string per Role.SYSTEM
    message) so the cache-control helper can emit one content block
    per semantic chunk (instructions / memory / recall) with its own
    cache_control marker. Callers that don't enable caching join
    with ``\\n\\n`` to recover the old single-string shape.

    ``thinking_map`` is the adapter's replay cache (first tool_use
    id -> the thinking / redacted_thinking blocks that preceded it).
    When extended thinking is on, the API requires those signed
    blocks to LEAD the assistant turn that carries tool_use — turns
    rebuilt without them are rejected with a 400.
