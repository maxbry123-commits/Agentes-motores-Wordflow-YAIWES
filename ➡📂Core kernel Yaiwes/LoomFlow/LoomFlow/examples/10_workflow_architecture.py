"""Example 10 — Agent with a non-default Architecture inside a Workflow.

Same outer shape as Example 7 (workflow wraps an agent) — but now
the agent uses ``architecture="self-refine"`` instead of the
default ReAct.

What this means concretely:

* Default ReAct Agent — one model call (or a tool-loop), the
  output is whatever the model said in that pass.
* SelfRefine Agent — internally drafts an answer, critiques it,
  refines, possibly multiple times. The OUTPUT is the
  post-refinement answer.

From the Workflow's perspective neither is visible — both shapes
return one string. The architecture is encapsulated in the
agent. **Workflow controls the pipeline; Architecture controls
the agent's internal reasoning. They're orthogonal axes.**

The audit log shows both: the workflow's ``step_started`` /
``step_completed`` AND the agent's ``run_started`` /
``run_completed`` — all in one trace, all attributed to the same
``user_id``.

Other architectures swap in identically — try
``architecture="reflexion"``, ``"tree_of_thoughts"``,
``"plan_and_execute"``, etc. The workflow doesn't care.
