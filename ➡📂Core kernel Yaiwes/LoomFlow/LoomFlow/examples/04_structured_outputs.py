"""Example 4 — Structured outputs with type-safe validation.

Real production agents need to emit *data*, not just prose. This
example shows the framework's structured-output contract end-to-end:

  1. Define a Pydantic ``BaseModel`` describing the shape you want.
  2. Pass it as ``output_schema=`` to ``agent.run()``.
  3. Read ``result.parsed`` — a typed, validated instance.

Under the hood:

  * The framework appends a JSON-schema directive to the run's
    system prompt (the static instructions you passed at
    construction stay unchanged).
  * The model emits JSON that matches; the framework parses it.
  * If parsing fails, the framework gives the model up to
    ``output_validation_retries`` (default 1) to fix the output —
    feeding the validation error back as a USER message so the
    model can correct itself. After that budget is exhausted,
    :class:`OutputValidationError` is raised.

What this example does:

  * Extracts a structured ``MeetingSummary`` from a raw meeting
    transcript — title, date, attendees, action items, decisions.
  * Demonstrates that the model output validates as a typed object
    you can index into, serialise back to JSON, etc.

TRANSCRIPT = """
Acme Corp — Engineering Sync
Date: 2026-05-04

Attendees: Mira Castellanos (CEO), Tomás Reyes (VP Eng), Priya Iyer
(staff engineer), Lukas Brandt (PM).

Mira opened by confirming the launch slip — the v2.0 release will
ship on May 28, two weeks later than originally planned. The team
agreed to use the extra time to harden the migration tooling rather
than ship more features.

Priya raised concern about the rollback story for tenants on the
old schema. Tomás said the platform team would own building a
shadow-replica path before launch; Priya volunteered to write the
RFC by next Friday. Lukas will update the launch comms to
customers by Monday so they have a week's notice of the date
change.

The meeting ended on a constructive note — everyone aligned on
the new date and the migration-tooling priority.
