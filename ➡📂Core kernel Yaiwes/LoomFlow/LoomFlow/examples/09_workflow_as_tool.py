"""Example 9 — Expose a Workflow as an Agent tool.

The opposite composition direction from Example 7. There an outer
workflow contained Agents; here an outer Agent has a workflow
available as a tool.

Use case: an open-ended customer-support Agent might handle a
hundred different conversation paths, but when the user actually
asks for a refund the response MUST follow a deterministic flow:
validate → record → notify. Wrapping that flow as a workflow and
exposing it via :meth:`~loomflow.Workflow.as_tool` gives the
Agent a deterministic compliance gate inside its otherwise free
reasoning.

The unified audit log shows both the agent's tool_call entry and
the workflow's per-step entries — same ``user_id``, same
``session_id``, single trace.

Run::

    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... python examples/09_workflow_as_tool.py
