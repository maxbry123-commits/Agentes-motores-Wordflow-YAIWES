"""Example 2 — Five domain specialists, each with their own RAG, debating.

Five specialist sub-Agents — IT technician, physicist, physician,
financial analyst, lawyer — each grounded in their own folder of PDFs:

    examples/data/it/         → indexed → Chroma collection 'it_docs'
    examples/data/physics/    → indexed → Chroma collection 'physics_docs'
    examples/data/medicine/   → indexed → Chroma collection 'medicine_docs'
    examples/data/finance/    → indexed → Chroma collection 'finance_docs'
    examples/data/law/        → indexed → Chroma collection 'law_docs'

Each specialist gets a retriever tool scoped to its own collection
and a system prompt forbidding it from answering outside its
domain. The five specialists are then composed via the **debate**
architecture: each takes a turn, they cross-react, and a judge
agent synthesises a single grounded answer.

    Team.debate(
        debaters=[it, phys, med, fin, law],
        judge=judge,
        rounds=2,
    )

Run::

    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... python examples/02_specialist_debate.py

The first run generates one PDF per domain (via reportlab) and
indexes each into its own persistent Chroma collection. Re-runs
reuse the on-disk indices.
