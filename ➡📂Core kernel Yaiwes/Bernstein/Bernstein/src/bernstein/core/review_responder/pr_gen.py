"""PR-body assembly for bernstein-authored pull requests.

Wires the abstract-diff layer (intent summaries + pseudocode) into the
markdown body posted on PR creation. The raw description supplied by
the spawning task is preserved at the top; the abstracted "Intent"
section follows, with collapsible ``<details>`` blocks that hold the
raw diff for drill-down.

This module is intentionally thin - the heavy lifting lives in
``bernstein.core.quality.review_pipeline.abstract_diff``. The split is
about layering: the responder owns *what shows up on the PR*, the
review pipeline owns *how the abstraction is computed*.
