"""Pydantic schema for a team-hub manifest (first slice).

A *team hub* is a git repository that ships shared agents, skills, and
rules so a whole team works against one source of truth - using ``git``
as the substrate (no SaaS dial-in, no second auth surface, normal PR
review).

This module defines the smallest contract every hub must satisfy:

- a top-level ``team-hub.yaml`` manifest enumerating what the hub ships
- each ``ships.{agents,skills,rules}`` entry is a relative path inside the
  hub repo, validated against directory traversal
- ``compatibility.bernstein`` is a PEP-440-style requirement specifier so
  the loader can refuse to merge a hub that targets a future Bernstein

Later slices will:

- clone / pull hub repos (``hub_loader.py`` Step 1 in the parent ticket)
- merge resolved entries into the role / skill / rule resolution paths
- expose a ``bernstein hub`` CLI

The schema lives here so those slices can import a single source of truth
instead of re-deriving the manifest shape ad hoc.
