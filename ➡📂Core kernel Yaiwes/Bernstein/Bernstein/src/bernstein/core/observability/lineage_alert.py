"""Tamper-loud alert sinks for the lineage chain.

When the janitor runs lineage compaction it also re-verifies the WAL
hash chain and the customer signature on every record. Detecting a
break is treated as a security event, not a bookkeeping warning -- the
operator's SIEM is the response surface, not Bernstein's logs. This
module defines the protocol every sink implements and ships a default
``WebhookAlertSink`` for vanilla HTTP collectors (Splunk HEC, generic
SIEM webhook, syslog-over-HTTP).

Design notes
------------
* The sink protocol is intentionally narrow: a single ``emit(event)``
  call. Concrete sinks decide their transport.
* The default webhook sink retries 5xx responses with exponential
  backoff so a momentarily flaky SIEM does not lose a tamper alert.
  Network errors and 5xx after the retry budget are swallowed -- the
  janitor is fail-loud-but-non-blocking on a broken sink.
* The alert payload is a dataclass, not a free-form dict, so a
  reviewer auditing what the sink can leak sees the full surface.
