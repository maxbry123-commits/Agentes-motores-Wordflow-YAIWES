"""``skills.lock`` extensions for catalog installs and cross-worktree consistency.

Layout
------

The existing :mod:`bernstein.core.skills.lifecycle` lockfile records
locally-sourced skills. Catalog installs extend the same physical file
with an additional ``[[catalog]]`` array of TOML tables::

    [[catalog]]
    id = "code-review"
    name = "code-review"
    version = "1.2.0"
    manifest_url = "github://acme/code-review-skill@v1.2.0"
    manifest_sha256 = "<hex>"
    content_digest = "<hex>"
    install_id = "<uuid>"
    chain_head = "<hex>"
    installed_at = "<isoformat>"

A second ``[[lineage_receipt]]`` array records every chain-head change
so a sibling worktree can decide deterministically whether to adopt the
upstream update or pin to the previous head.

Atomicity
---------

The lockfile is written to a sibling ``.tmp`` file and then
:func:`pathlib.Path.replace` swaps it into place, which is atomic on
POSIX and on Windows (since 3.3). Parallel worktrees launched from the
same chain head therefore observe identical post-write state.
