"""Consume side: fetch a peer capability card, verify, gate on policy.

Before delegating a sub-task to a peer agent over A2A, Bernstein:

1. fetches the peer's capability card (from a local artefact or an HTTP
   ``.well-known`` endpoint);
2. verifies the card's detached JWS and rejects expired cards
   (:func:`bernstein.core.interop.a2a_card.verify_capability_card`);
3. confirms the card's signing key fingerprint is in the operator's
   trusted-issuer set;
4. proceeds only if the card's advertised policies meet the operator's
   required policies (cost cap, sandbox profile, redaction tier).

The policy gate is conservative: a peer must advertise a cost cap at or
below the operator's ceiling, a sandbox profile at least as strong as the
operator requires, and a redaction tier at least as strong as the operator
requires. Unknown ordinal values fail closed.
