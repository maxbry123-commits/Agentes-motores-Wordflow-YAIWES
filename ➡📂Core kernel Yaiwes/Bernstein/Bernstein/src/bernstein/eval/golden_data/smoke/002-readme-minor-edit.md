Find one small, low-risk copy edit in `README.md` - a typo, a missing
period, a stray double space, or an awkward phrasing - and fix only that.

Constraints:

- diff must be <= 3 changed lines,
- do not modify headings, links, code blocks, or tables,
- do not add or remove sections,
- do not reflow paragraphs.

If no such issue exists, exit without modifying any file and report
"no fixable nit found".
