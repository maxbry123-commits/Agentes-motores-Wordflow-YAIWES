# Bernstein Status

Show the current state of the Bernstein orchestrator.

## When to Use

- User asks "what's the status?" or "how's the build going?"
- User wants to see active agents, open tasks, or costs
- User asks about progress, failures, or alerts
- User wants a quick overview of the orchestration run

## Instructions

1. Run `scripts/status.sh` to fetch the full dashboard data from the Bernstein API.
2. Parse the JSON output and present a clear summary:

### Summary format

```
## Bernstein Status

**Agents:** {active_count} active | **Tasks:** {done}/{total} done | **Cost:** ${cost_usd}

### Active Agents
| Agent | Role | Model | Runtime | Task | Cost |
|-------|------|-------|---------|------|------|
| {id}  | {role} | {model} | {runtime}m | {task_title} | ${cost} |

### Tasks
- {open} open, {claimed} claimed, {done} done, {failed} failed

### Alerts
- {alert messages if any}

### Cost Breakdown
- Budget: ${budget} | Spent: ${spent} ({percentage}%)
- Per model: {breakdown}
```

3. If the API is not reachable, tell the user to start Bernstein with `bernstein run`.
4. Highlight any alerts (failed tasks, budget warnings, stalled agents) prominently.
