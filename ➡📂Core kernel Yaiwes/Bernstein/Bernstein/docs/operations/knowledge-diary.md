# Knowledge layer: diary + synthesis

Bernstein keeps a two-tier knowledge layer over task transcripts.

1. **Diary**: a per-task structured entry distilled from the closing
   transcript. Stored at `.sdd/runtime/diaries/<task_id>.json`.
2. **Synthesis**: a periodic aggregation pass that groups diaries into
   themes and drafts a human-readable report at
   `.sdd/runtime/syntheses/<date>.md`.

The synthesis is **HITL-gated**. Reports land on disk with
`approved: false` in their frontmatter until an operator runs the
synthesize command with `--apply`. No role prompt is mutated by the
synthesizer alone; it always produces review artefacts.

## CLI surface

```bash
# List every diary entry in the active SDD tree.
bernstein knowledge diary list

# Show one entry.
bernstein knowledge diary show task-42

# Run the synthesis pass over the last 14 days.
bernstein knowledge synthesize --since 14d

# Render to stdout without writing.
bernstein knowledge synthesize --since 7d --dry-run

# Approve and persist (the HITL gate).
bernstein knowledge synthesize --since 7d --apply
```

`--since` accepts `NNd`, `NNh`, `NNm`, `NNs`, or a bare integer (days).

## Diary shape

Each diary entry carries:

| Field            | Description                                                   |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `task_id`        | Source task identifier.                                        |
| `tried`          | Bullet list of attempted approaches.                           |
| `worked`         | Bullet list of approaches that succeeded.                      |
| `failed`         | Bullet list of approaches that failed.                         |
| `rationale`      | Free-text explanation.                                         |
| `tags`           | Lower-cased, deduplicated tokens used for clustering.          |
| `redaction_hash` | SHA-256 of the redacted transcript.                            |
| `created_at`     | ISO-8601 timestamp in UTC.                                     |
| `schema_version` | Integer schema version (currently 1).                          |

The diary writer redacts known credential shapes (OpenAI keys, GitHub
tokens, AWS access keys, PEM banners, generic hex bearer tokens)
before hashing or persisting. Verification works on the redacted form,
so two transcripts that differ only in the masked substrings still
verify against the same entry.

## Synthesis algorithm

Clustering uses tag-overlap Jaccard similarity with a configurable
threshold (default `0.34`). Embeddings are deliberately out of scope
for v1; the stdlib implementation is cheap and fully deterministic.
Clusters smaller than `--min-cluster-size` are dropped. Themes are
sorted by size descending so the operator sees the strongest signals
first.

Each theme carries a `proposed_diff` body that summarises recurring
failure patterns and recurring success patterns from the cluster. The
body is markdown shaped like a unified diff (`+`/`-` prefixes); it is a
review aid, not an actual diff that gets applied.

## Storage paths

| Path                                | Purpose                                  |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `.sdd/runtime/diaries/<task_id>.json` | Per-task diary entry (atomic write).   |
| `.sdd/runtime/syntheses/<date>.md`  | Synthesis report (overwritten per day). |

Both writes go through the atomic-write helper, so a crash mid-flush
never leaves a torn file behind.
