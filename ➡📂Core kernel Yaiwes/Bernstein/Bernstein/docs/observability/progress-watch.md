# ProgressWatch - agent liveness via session-log growth

ProgressWatch is a small observability primitive that decides whether a
spawned CLI agent is "stuck or just thinking" without parsing the
agent's own stdout. It watches a structured session log on disk: if the
log file's mtime or size moves forward, the agent is making progress.
If it has not moved for `agents.progress_watch.inactivity_seconds`, the
watcher records a stall and asks the dispatch loop to escalate.

The watcher does not spawn its own thread and does not kill processes
directly. The dispatch loop tick (every 30s by default) calls
`ProgressWatch.tick()` and inspects the returned `StallEvent` list.
When a session has been idle past
`agents.progress_watch.kill_after_inactivity_seconds`,
`kill_if_stale(session_id)` returns a `sigkill` verdict that the loop
uses to decide what signal to send.

## Public surface

| Symbol | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ProgressWatch.register(session_id, log_path, adapter=...)` | Begin watching a log file for a session. |
| `ProgressWatch.unregister(session_id)` | Stop watching. Idempotent. |
| `ProgressWatch.tick()` | Sample every registered log. Returns newly-detected stalls. |
| `ProgressWatch.drain_pending_events()` | Read and clear the buffered stall events. |
| `ProgressWatch.kill_if_stale(session_id)` | Return the kill verdict for one session (`none`/`sigterm`/`sigkill`). |
| `CLIAdapter.supports_session_log_watch` | Class attribute; `True` when the adapter exposes a structured log path. |
| `CLIAdapter.session_log_path_for(session_id)` | Return the absolute log path for the given Bernstein session, or `None`. |

## Configuration

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `agents.progress_watch.enabled` | `true` | Master switch for the watcher. |
| `agents.progress_watch.inactivity_seconds` | `120` | Idle gap before a stall is emitted. |
| `agents.progress_watch.kill_after_inactivity_seconds` | `300` | Idle gap before the watcher escalates to SIGKILL. |

These defaults are also exposed as constants on
`bernstein.core.observability.progress_watch` for callers that want to
build a watcher without parsing config:

* `DEFAULT_INACTIVITY_SECONDS`
* `DEFAULT_KILL_AFTER_INACTIVITY_SECONDS`
* `DEFAULT_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS`

## Lifecycle event

When a stall is detected, the dispatch loop forwards the
`StallEvent` onto the lifecycle hook bus:

```text
event:   agent.progress_stalled
data:
  adapter:             "<adapter name>"
  log_path:            "<absolute path>"
  last_log_growth_ts:  <unix ts>
  detected_ts:         <unix ts>
```

The event name is also available as
`LifecycleEvent.AGENT_PROGRESS_STALLED`.

## Per-adapter log paths

The watcher itself is adapter-agnostic. Adapters opt in by setting
`supports_session_log_watch = True` and overriding
`session_log_path_for(session_id)`. The default returns `None`, which
makes the dispatch loop skip the adapter and fall back to plain
process-exit detection.

| Adapter | `supports_session_log_watch` | Log location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `claude` | yes | `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<session-uuid>.jsonl` (latest match) |
| `codex` | no (planned) | `~/.codex/sessions/<id>.log` (per upstream CLI) |
| `cursor` | no (planned) | `~/.cursor/agents/<id>.jsonl` (per upstream CLI) |
| `aider` | no (planned) | `<workdir>/.aider.chat.history.md` |
| `gemini` | no (planned) | `~/.gemini/sessions/<id>.log` |
| `opencode` | no (planned) | `~/.opencode/sessions/<id>.jsonl` |

Adapters not in this table use the inherited default and rely on
process-exit detection. New adapters can opt in at any time by adding
the override; no changes to the watcher itself are required.

## Operational notes

* The watcher treats a missing log file as "no growth", not as an
  error. Adapters may register a log path before the CLI creates the
  file; the first observed mtime/size move counts as the first growth.
* Stall events are sticky: once a session has been flagged as stalled,
  the watcher does not re-emit until the log grows again, at which
  point the sticky state clears and the cycle starts over.
* Auto-restart of a killed agent is out of scope for this primitive
  (see the retry-with-continuation work).
