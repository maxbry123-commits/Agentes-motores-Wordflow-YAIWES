"""Stateful WAL property test: append → restart → recover convergence.

Models the orchestrator's relationship with the WAL using Hypothesis's
``RuleBasedStateMachine``. The machine drives a writer through random
append / kill-and-restart / verify cycles and asserts that:

- After every restart, the writer resumes the chain at the previous
  ``entry_hash`` (no chain breakage on boot).
- ``WALReader.verify_chain()`` always succeeds against the on-disk
  history (no torn-line breakage from a clean shutdown - torn-line
  recovery is a separate concern handled by the truncation tests).
- Every appended entry survives the simulated kill, regardless of
  whether ``committed`` was True or False at append time.

The machine intentionally exercises only the *clean* write/restart
path. Torn-line scenarios (mid-write SIGKILL with partial bytes) are
covered by ``tests/unit/test_wal_recovery.py`` because they require
deterministic byte truncation that's awkward to express as a
state-machine rule.
