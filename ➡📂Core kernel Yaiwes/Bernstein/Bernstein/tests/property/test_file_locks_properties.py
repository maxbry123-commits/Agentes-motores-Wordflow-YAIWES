"""Property tests for ``FileLockManager`` contention semantics.

The lock manager mediates concurrent agent file ownership. Bugs here
result in two agents simultaneously editing the same file - silent
data corruption with no immediate signal. Properties:

* **Acquire is exclusive across agents** - for any random sequence
  of acquires from distinct agents, no file ends up held by more than
  one agent simultaneously.

* **Acquire is idempotent for the same agent** - repeated acquires
  by the same agent for overlapping file sets are silently accepted
  and do not deadlock or drop locks.

* **Release purges everything for that agent** - after a release,
  zero locks attributed to that agent remain in the table.

* **Concurrent acquire/release converges to a consistent state**
  under thread contention: the total set of locked files in the
  table is a subset of the union of all attempted acquires, and
  every lock has exactly one agent owner.

The threaded property uses small example budgets (20 examples × 4
agents) to keep CI wall-time predictable; the existing
``test_claim_next_properties.py`` precedent is dialed to a similar
budget.
