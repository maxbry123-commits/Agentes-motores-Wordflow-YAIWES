"""Property tests for the content-addressed-storage (CAS) store.

The CAS store is the deduplication primitive backing artefact storage.
A regression here either silently drops content (data loss) or causes
hash collisions on benign inputs (correctness bug). Properties:

* **put-then-get round-trip** - any byte payload stored under its
  digest reads back identically.

* **Digest is content-determined** - two stores of the same bytes
  yield the same digest; two stores of distinct bytes yield distinct
  digests. The first is the contract the orchestrator relies on for
  deduplication; the second is the no-collision-on-benign-input
  guarantee.

* **Digest validates as 64 hex chars** - the producer must always
  emit a value the validator accepts. A drift here would cause
  read paths to refuse to serve content that the write path just
  stored.

* **Path-traversal digests are rejected by ``get``** - feeding a
  ``../../etc/passwd``-style string into the digest API must raise
  ``ValueError`` before any filesystem call. This is a defence-in-
  depth check on the CAS root.

* **Repeated puts dedup correctly** - the second put of an
  identical payload increments the dedup counter and does not touch
  the blob on disk.

* **A single-byte mutation of any stored blob fails the verifying
  read** - the read path re-hashes against the requested digest, so
  tampering or bit rot surfaces as ``CASIntegrityError`` rather than
  being served as authentic.
