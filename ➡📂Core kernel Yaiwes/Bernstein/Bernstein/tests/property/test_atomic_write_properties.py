"""Property tests for the atomic-write helpers.

``write_atomic_bytes/text/json`` is the crash-safe write primitive used
by every runtime-state writer in ``.sdd/``. The properties here exist
to catch regressions that would silently corrupt readers under adverse
conditions:

* **Round-trip soundness** across every Hypothesis-generated payload
  (binary, UTF-8 text, JSON values) - readers must always see the
  exact bytes/text/value the writer was handed.

* **No stale tmp slot leakage** - after any successful write the
  parent directory must contain only ``path`` itself; the
  ``.tmp.<pid>.<rand>`` shim file is never visible after replace().

* **Repeat-write convergence** - repeated writes with different
  payloads on the same path always leave the *last* payload visible,
  never an intermediate value. Catches accidental write-then-fsync
  ordering bugs.

* **Concurrent writers do not corrupt readers** - when N threads
  hammer the same path with distinct payloads, a concurrent reader
  always observes a fully-formed previous payload, never a torn
  intermediate. Catches non-atomic rename regressions (e.g. a refactor
  that swaps ``os.replace`` for ``shutil.move``).

Each property uses small max-example budgets so the file completes in
under ~10 s on a GitHub-hosted runner.
