"""WAL crash-recovery with :class:`BufferedSink` (oai-003).

This test simulates an orchestrator killed mid-run with a BufferedSink
configured. It asserts two things:

1. The local fsync semantics are preserved - every WAL line the WAL
   writer emitted is on disk after the simulated crash.
2. The asynchronous mirror eventually reproduces the same WAL on the
   remote sink. (A separate integration test against LocalStack
   exercises the cloud wire path; this one uses a LocalFsSink as the
   'remote' so it runs in every environment.)

Runs as an integration test because it spans the WAL module, the
storage package, and asyncio lifecycles.
