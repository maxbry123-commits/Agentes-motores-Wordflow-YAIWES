"""Unit and regression tests for reap-and-merge quality gates (#4393).

Verifies that:
1. A task whose agent exits immediately after `task complete` has a `gates/<task>.json`
   verdict written before its branch is merged.
2. A blocking gate failure on that path leaves the agent branch unmerged.
3. A passing gate allows the merge to succeed.
