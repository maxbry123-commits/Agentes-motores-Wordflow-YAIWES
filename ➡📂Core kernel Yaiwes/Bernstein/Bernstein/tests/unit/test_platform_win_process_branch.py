"""Windows-branch coverage for the process-lifecycle platform layer.

These tests exercise the Windows code paths of
``bernstein.core.config.platform_compat`` on any host by substituting a
mock ``kernel32`` / ``subprocess.run`` and flipping ``IS_WINDOWS``. They
carry no platform skip marker: the Windows branches are pure logic once
the kernel calls are mocked, so parity coverage no longer waits for a
Windows runner.

The reap-receipt cases assert the *verifiable artifact* itself: the
:class:`ProcessReapReceipt` is a deterministic projection of the platform
onto ``(os_name, method, delivered, already_gone, escalated,
confirmed_dead)``. On Windows the force tier must fall back to the numeric
``9`` code because ``SIGKILL`` does not exist, and the receipt must record
``windows_process_tree`` as the mechanism. Stripping that projection is
what a Windows regression looks like, so we pin it here rather than only on
a Windows host.

Three properties get dedicated coverage because Windows recycles pids fast
enough for all of them to matter in practice:

* a target that was *observed* to have already exited is a satisfied reap,
  not a failed one - nothing is left running, which is the whole point of
  the call;
* no stop tier may ever act on a pid that might have been recycled into an
  unrelated process, so the reap pins the target with an open handle and
  refuses a process that started after the reap was requested; and
* "could not observe" is a third answer, never folded into either of the
  first two.  ``OpenProcess`` refuses a pid nothing holds and a pid held by
  a process this user may not touch with different error codes, a handle
  can be open and still decline to report an exit code, and a mismatched
  creation time says the number is not the target rather than that the
  target is gone.  Each of those leaves both ``already_gone`` and
  ``confirmed_dead`` False: the receipt is signed into the audit chain, so
  an absence of evidence must not serialise as evidence of absence.
