"""``typecheck-ts.yml`` must actually cover the packages it claims to.

The workflow is a gate whose scope is declared in two independent places
that nothing forces to agree:

*The trigger.* ``on.pull_request.paths`` decides whether the workflow
runs at all. A TypeScript package outside that list gets no job, so a
pull request touching only that package reports zero TypeScript checks -
green, because nothing ran.

*The matrix.* ``strategy.matrix.include`` decides which packages the
workflow that did run typechecks. A package inside the trigger but
outside the matrix is worse than uncovered: the workflow reports success
having never compiled it.

Both are silent by construction, so both are asserted here against the
repository tree rather than against a restated list. A ``package.json``
that declares ``typescript`` is a package whose types CI can break and
whose dependency bumps automation will open pull requests for; from then
on this file requires it in the trigger and in the matrix, and the change
that adds the manifest is the one that has to wire up CI.

The install step is asserted for the same reason. ``npm ci`` aborts when
the package has no lockfile, which turns a newly covered package into a
job that dies before ``tsc`` runs.
