# Miloco 2.0 User Guide

Miloco 2.0 is Xiaomi's open-source whole-home AI solution, built on [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) — an AI housekeeper that observes, reasons, and understands your home better the longer you live with it.

This guide focuses on how to use Miloco once it's installed. For product positioning, the full feature list, and installation details, see the [README](README.md); below, we first get acquainted with Miloco, then start using it.

# 1. Getting to Know Miloco 2.0

## 1.1 What Is Miloco 2.0

Miloco 2.0 uses the video and audio from Xiaomi Home cameras as its omni-modal perception input, the self-developed MiMo Large Model as its intelligent brain, and runs as an Agent plugin on top of [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai): it perceives what happens at home, makes proactive judgments based on common sense, and acts by orchestrating Xiaomi Home devices — providing personalized service for each member through Identity Recognition and Family Memory.

## 1.2 Five Key Features

Miloco's capabilities are built on five features: **General Common Sense, Identity Recognition, Family Memory, Family Tasks, and Proactive Intelligence**. See [Core Features in the README](README.md#core-features) for details on each.

## 1.3 Two Core Capabilities

These five features come together into two core capabilities:

- **Proactive Intelligence Powered by Common Sense and Memory**: Combining General Common Sense, Identity Recognition, and Family Memory, Miloco continuously observes your home — issuing tiered alerts when it detects danger or anomalies, and serving each family member according to their preferences. No rule-by-rule configuration; it works out of the box and gets to know you better over time.
- **Complex Family Tasks**: Miloco breaks vague, long-term goals (drink 8 glasses of water a day, get reminded after sitting too long, take medication on time) into trackable family tasks — automatically counting, tracking progress, and reminding on schedule, with the Agent interpreting intent and executing autonomously.

For how to use these two core capabilities, see Chapter 2, "Getting Started," below.

# 2. Getting Started

Daily use comes down to one guiding principle: **just tell OpenClaw what you want**. Recognizing people, remembering habits, managing tasks, proactively watching over your home with common sense — Miloco decides which of these capabilities (see Chapter 1) to invoke on its own. You don't need to memorize commands or worry about which feature is at work behind the scenes.

> [!TIP]
> **Raise your own Miloco.** Its out-of-the-box behavior won't always match your taste—just tell Miloco through OpenClaw (e.g. "don't remind me when the place is messy"), and it remembers your preference and adjusts what it does proactively. Every remark "raises" a Miloco that's tuned to your home, and it knows you better the longer you live with it.

## 2.1 Just Say What You Want

Simply follow the examples below:

- **Introduce Family Members**: "Add a family member named Wang Lei, he's Dad," "Get to know me," "Who's registered in our home?"

  ![Introduce family members](assets/chat_add_member_en.png)

- **Remember Preferences**: "Remember, Dad doesn't like the lights too bright," "Remember, we usually go to bed at 11."

  ![Remember preferences](assets/chat_remember_pref_en.png)

- **Tune Proactive Reminders**: "Don't bother reminding me when the place is messy," "Stop nagging me to tidy up." — Tell it which kinds of proactive reminders you do or don't want; it records this in your family profile, and from then on the camera perception judges accordingly and simply stops raising those reminders. **Every offhand remark like this "raises" Miloco**—the longer you live with it, the better it knows you and the less it interrupts.

- **Build Habits / Check-Ins**: "Drink 8 glasses of water a day," "Make sure I exercise once a day."

  ![Build habits / check-ins](assets/chat_build_habit_en.png)
- **Set Reminders**: "Remind me to check the stove in 30 minutes," "Wake me up at 7 a.m. on weekdays."
- **Track Duration**: "Remind me when my kid plays the iPad for 1 hour straight," "Remind me to get up and move after sitting for 50 minutes."
- **Query / Control Devices**: "Is anyone in the living room?" "Turn off the bedroom light."

It then confirms in plain language. For example, if you say "drink 8 glasses of water a day," it might reply:

> Done! I'll remind you to drink water at 10:00, 12:00, 14:00, 16:00, 18:00, and 20:00 every day, and reset your progress automatically each midnight.

## 2.2 Managing & Reviewing

- **Manage Tasks**: "What tasks do I have now?" "Pause the water reminder," "Change the water goal to 10 glasses," "Stop tracking my water intake."
- **Review What It Did**: Open the "Logs" page of the Web Dashboard (see Chapter 3) to see the full record of every "perceive → judge → act" cycle.

**Note**: Habit-tracking and behavior-counting tasks rely on camera perception. If your home has no camera and no microphone-equipped device, such tasks can't be created. Pure scheduled reminders (e.g., "wake me at 8 tomorrow") don't require a camera.

# 3. Web Home Dashboard

Besides conversation, Miloco offers a Web dashboard you can view and operate directly on your phone, tablet, or computer.

## 3.1 How to Access

- **Method 1**: Once the backend service is running, open `http://127.0.0.1:1810/` in a browser (on the host machine); from other devices on the same Wi-Fi, visit `http://<host-IP>:1810/`.
- **Method 2**: Run `miloco-cli dashboard` in your terminal to open the dashboard in your browser automatically — no need to type the address.

## 3.2 What the Dashboard Offers

- **Overview**: Watch live "right now at home" feeds from online cameras with one click; works across browsers on every platform.

- **Devices**: See the status of all your devices at a glance, organized by room.
