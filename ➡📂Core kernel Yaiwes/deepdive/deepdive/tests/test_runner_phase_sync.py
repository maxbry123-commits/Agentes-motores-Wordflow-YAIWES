"""Canary: does the runner scaffold still match the methodology's phase list?

The runner (`runner/orchestrator.py`) is a deliberately smaller, UNSYNCED subset of the
skill methodology — see `runner/DESIGN.md` "Scope & sync boundary". `phases.yaml` is the
single source of truth (currently 11 phases); the runner implements 8.

This test is a CANARY, not a gate: it WARNS when the gap changes so it stays visible in
CI output, but it does NOT fail. Parity with the skill is explicitly not a goal without a
driving use case. If you close the gap (grow the runner) or widen it (add a skill phase),
update `Orchestrator.IMPLEMENTED_PHASE_IDS` and this test's `KNOWN_MISSING` so the canary
reflects the intended state.
