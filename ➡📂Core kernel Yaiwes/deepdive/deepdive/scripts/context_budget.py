"""
Context-budget instrumentation for the deep-research skill.

The skill ships ~154k tokens of markdown across SKILL.md + references/. That is
fine *only* if progressive loading is disciplined: load a reference when you reach
the phase that needs it, never preemptively. This script makes that discipline
measurable instead of aspirational.

It does three things:
  1. Inventories every .md under the skill root, grouping by directory, and prints
     a token-proxy report (bytes / 4, the same proxy score_run.py uses).
  2. Models named load-profiles (what a given depth actually pulls into context)
     and reports each as a share of a target window.
  3. In --ci mode, fails (exit 1) if the always-loaded floor or SKILL.md itself
     exceeds the configured budget — so a PR that bloats SKILL.md is caught.

Usage:
    python scripts/context_budget.py                       # full report
    python scripts/context_budget.py --window 200000       # share of a 200k window
    python scripts/context_budget.py --ci                  # enforce budgets, exit 1 on breach
    python scripts/context_budget.py --json budget.json     # machine-readable

No third-party deps. Run from the repo root (or pass --root).

# Raised from 56000 on 2026-08-17: round-workspace rebuild (state.md, Phase 4),
# per-section synthesis over outline.md (Phase 6), numbers.csv arithmetic and Layer 4
# construct provenance (Phase 6.5) cost ~950 tok in the floor. Their detail was pushed
# into phase-scoped refs (subagents_v2 / synthesis_outline / source_scoring /
# runtime_verification); only the rules stayed in SKILL.md and workflow.md.

# Files SKILL.md marks as "Базовые" — the unavoidable floor for a medium/deep run.
#
# Trimmed 2026-08-17. These refs left the floor because no medium/deep run reads them
# unconditionally; they still load from their own phase, and the profiles below account
# for that:
#   refresh_protocol.md        — `update <slug>` mode only, never on a fresh run
#   capability_discovery.md    — Phase 3.5, mandatory on deep only
#   awesome_lists_registry.md  — fallback inside Phase 3.5
#   stat_sources/INDEX.md      — Phase 4, only for quantitative subquestions
#   api_sources/INDEX.md       — Phase 4, only when a registry/API channel is dispatched
# plan_gate.md joined the floor in the same pass: Phase 3.7 is skipped on shallow only,
# so every medium/deep run reads it. SKILL.md already listed it as base while this list
# did not — the floor was understated by ~3.3k tok.
