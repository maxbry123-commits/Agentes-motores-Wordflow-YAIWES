"""
Phase-gate validator for a completed deep-research run directory.

The methodology in references/ is executed only by the model's discipline inside a
Claude Code session — nothing forces a phase to actually run. This script closes
that gap: it checks that a finished run's output folder contains the file artifact
of every phase that is MANDATORY for the run's depth mode. It catches "the model
skipped a phase" — the failure mode the whole skill is most exposed to (H3).

Depth mode drives which phases are mandatory. The source of truth for that is the
`depth_gate` field in phases.yaml (loaded via phases_manifest — no second YAML
parser). This script owns only the phase->artifact mapping, because not every phase
emits a file and some emit an either/or or a set of files, which does not fit a
scalar YAML field.

It validates PHASE COMPLETENESS, not artifact format (that's eval/validate_structure.py)
and not research quality (that's eval/score_run.py). The two structural validators
are complementary: run both.

Checks (errors fail --strict; warnings never do):
  - every phase mandatory for the mode emitted its artifact(s)
  - mode is known explicitly (--mode) or read from the report/plan frontmatter
  - the phase->artifact table still covers every file-emitting phase in phases.yaml
    (a self-check: adding such a phase without updating this table warns loudly)

Usage:
    python scripts/validate_phases.py --research-dir research/<slug>
    python scripts/validate_phases.py --research-dir research/<slug> --mode deep
    python scripts/validate_phases.py --research-dir research/<slug> --strict   # exit 1 on errors
    python scripts/validate_phases.py --research-dir research/<slug> --json
