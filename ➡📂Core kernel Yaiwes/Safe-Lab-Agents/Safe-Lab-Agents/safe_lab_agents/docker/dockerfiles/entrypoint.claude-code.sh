# =============================================================================
# Entrypoint for the Claude Code agent container.
#
# Environment variables (set by the DockerManager):
#   MCP_PORT      – TCP port of the MCP server on the host.
#   MCP_HOST      – Hostname/IP of the MCP server (defaults to host.docker.internal;
#                   set to the WSL gateway IP for Podman on Windows).
#   MODE          – "interactive" or "autonomous".
#   TASK_PROMPT   – The task description (only used in autonomous mode).
#   CONTEXT_DIR   – Path to the read-only context directory (optional).
#   NO_WEB        – If "true", the WebSearch/WebFetch tools are hard-blocked in
#                   every mode via --disallowedTools (deny rules apply even under
#                   --dangerously-skip-permissions).  This is a TOOL-level block,
#                   not a network one: other egress vectors (Bash curl/wget,
#                   Python) are covered only by a system-prompt restriction, since
#                   the container keeps full network egress (required for the
#                   agent's own model API).
#   CLAUDE_MODEL  – Optional model alias or full name passed to --model.
#   CLAUDE_EFFORT – Optional effort level (low/medium/high/xhigh/max) passed to --effort.
#   EGRESS_LOCKDOWN – If "true", apply the in-container egress firewall
#                   (/firewall.sh) before dropping privileges: the host is then
#                   reachable ONLY on the MCP port and private/LAN ranges are
#                   blocked, while the public internet (model API) stays open.

# ---- Egress lockdown + privilege drop (root phase) ----
# The container starts as root (no USER directive) solely so this block can
# install the egress firewall, which needs CAP_NET_ADMIN. It must run before
# anything else — especially before any file is written — and must not create
# files itself (root-owned files in the bind mounts would be unwritable for
# the host user). It then permanently drops to the 'agent' user via setpriv
# and re-execs this script; the exec keeps PID 1 and the controlling TTY, so
# interactive/resume/login flows behave exactly as before. After the drop no
# capabilities remain and no-new-privileges prevents reacquisition, so the
# firewall rules are immutable from inside the container.

# ---- Make everything the agent creates writable from the host ----
# The agent runs as the non-root 'agent' user, whose UID never matches the host
# user (and maps to a subuid under rootless Podman). Files it writes into the
# bind mounts would default to 0644/0755, leaving the host user unable to edit
# or clean them up — and the host can't chown/chmod them back (it isn't the
# owner and lacks CAP_FOWNER for a subuid). umask 000 makes new files 0666 and
# dirs 0777, so the host (the 'other' class) can read, write, and delete them.
# Explicit chmods below (e.g. the 600 on credentials) still take precedence.

# ---- Scrub OAuth credentials before the container is committed ----
# Claude Code stores the account credential in ~/.claude/.credentials.json
# (written from the host env below, or minted by an in-container login). The
# host commits the *exited* container on stop, so without this the credential
# would persist in the committed session image — readable via docker save/export
# by anyone with container-runtime access. Remove it when the entrypoint (PID 1)
# exits, before the snapshot is taken; resume re-authenticates (in-container
# login, or --agent-args oauth-token=…). The transcripts under ~/.claude/projects
# are untouched, so `--resume` still finds the conversation. Best-effort — never
# block shutdown. (Autonomous mode runs claude in the background rather than
# exec-ing it precisely so this trap still fires on exit.)

# ---- Network resilience: abort & retry stalled streams ----
# On the direct Anthropic API route (OAuth credentials), Claude Code has no
# default idle-stream timeout — that abort-on-stall default ships only for the
# Vertex/Foundry routes.  Podman's userspace network proxy (gvproxy) — used on
# macOS (applehv/vfkit) and on the Windows/WSL2 VM alike, as well as Docker
# Desktop's NAT — silently reaps an idle TCP flow without an RST.  During a
# cold-cache, max-effort first turn the time-to-first-byte (or a mid-stream
# gap) is long enough that the socket is dropped, and the CLI stalls mid-turn
# ("thinking", tokens frozen) until a watchdog aborts and retries.
#
# The window measures wire silence (no bytes/SSE events), NOT thinking time:
# a long think still streams tokens and the API sends periodic ping events, so
# it never trips.  We enable both watchdogs and set the BYTE-level idle timeout
# via CLAUDE_BYTE_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS — this is the effective recovery timer
# and it has no floor (clamp 10s..30min).  Do NOT rely on
# CLAUDE_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS: the CLI applies Math.max(it, 300000), so it
# can never lower recovery, and merely setting it *suppresses* the built-in
# 180000 ms first-party byte-watchdog default (pinning recovery up to 5 min).
# 90000 ms is comfortably above any healthy cold first-byte latency (the CLI's
# slow-first-byte warning fires at 30s) while cutting the observed ~5 min stall
# to ~90s.  All values are overridable via env passed into the container.
