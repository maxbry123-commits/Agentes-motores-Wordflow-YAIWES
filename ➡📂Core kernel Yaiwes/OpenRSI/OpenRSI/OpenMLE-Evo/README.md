# OpenMLE-Evo

OpenMLE-Evo is the test-time search and evaluation system used in *Frontis-MA1: Training an AI4AI Model towards Recursive Self-Improvement in Machine Learning Engineering*.

MLE-Bench and NatureBench Lite-v2 are parallel benchmark adapters over one shared AIRA-Evo runtime. Standard and asynchronous multi-GPU search use the same journal, checkpoint, memory, parent-selection, and output implementation.

## Benchmark Adapters

| Adapter | Entrypoint | Runbook |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MLE-Bench | `scripts/evaluate_airaevo.py` | [`benchmarks/mle_bench/`](benchmarks/mle_bench/) |
| NatureBench Lite-v2 | `scripts/evaluate_naturebench.py` | [`benchmarks/naturebench_lite_v2/`](benchmarks/naturebench_lite_v2/) |
| NatureBench local quick | `scripts/run_naturebench_local.py` | [`benchmarks/naturebench_local_quick/`](benchmarks/naturebench_local_quick/) |

## Repository Contents

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `scripts/` | Standard, multi-GPU, and NatureBench launchers |
| `tts_search/` | Search, sandbox, scoring, prompting, guidance, and Hydra configuration |
| `benchmarks/` | MLE-Bench and NatureBench Lite-v2 adapters |
| `third_party/aira-evo/` | Vendored AIRA-Dojo runtime |
| `tests/` | Existing public configuration and scheduler checks |
| `docs/` | Architecture, operations, validation, and source scope |

## Quick Start

```bash
cd OpenMLE-Evo
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
```

After configuring `.env`, use `./scripts/run_standard.sh` for the standard MLE-Bench profile or follow the benchmark-specific runbook.

For a one-candidate NatureBench check that executes generated code in a local
Conda environment, follow [`benchmarks/naturebench_local_quick/README.md`](benchmarks/naturebench_local_quick/README.md).
