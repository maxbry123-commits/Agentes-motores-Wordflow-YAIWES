# binex bisect

## Synopsis

```
binex bisect <GOOD_RUN_ID> <BAD_RUN_ID> [OPTIONS]   # across nodes (default)
binex bisect history -w <WORKFLOW> --good <REF> --bad <REF> [OPTIONS]
```

`binex bisect` finds a regression at two granularities:

- **Across nodes** (default) — given a good and a bad *run*, find the first node where they diverge.
- **Across git history** (`history`) — given a good and a bad *commit*, find the commit that broke the workflow, then hand off to the node-level bisect to locate the offending node within it.

The bare `binex bisect <good> <bad>` form is unchanged and still routes to the node-level bisect.

## Description (node-level)

Find the divergence point between two runs. Compares runs node-by-node, classifying each as a match, status difference, or content difference. Identifies the first node where the two runs diverge — helping you pinpoint where a regression or behavior change was introduced.

The comparison uses content similarity (via `difflib.SequenceMatcher`) to detect subtle output differences even when both nodes completed successfully.

## Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GOOD_RUN_ID` | Yes | The "known good" run (baseline) |
| `BAD_RUN_ID` | Yes | The "known bad" run (comparison) |

## Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--threshold` | `float` | `0.9` | Content similarity threshold (0.0-1.0). Nodes with similarity below this are flagged as `content_diff` |
| `--diff` | flag | false | Show full unified diffs instead of content preview |
| `--json` | flag | false | Output as JSON |
| `--rich / --no-rich` | flag | auto | Rich formatted output (auto-detected if `rich` is installed) |

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Success |
| 1 | Run not found |

## Examples

```bash
# Find where two runs diverge
binex bisect run_good run_bad

# Stricter content comparison
binex bisect run_good run_bad --threshold 0.95

# Show full diffs for changed nodes
binex bisect run_good run_bad --diff

# JSON for scripting
binex bisect run_good run_bad --json
```

## Output

### Plain text (default)

```
Bisecting: run_good vs run_bad

  planner       match
  researcher    match
  validator     content_diff  (similarity: 0.72)
    Good: {"validated": 9, "papers": [...]}
    Bad:  {"validated": 5, "papers": [...]}
  summarizer    status_diff   (completed -> failed)

Verdict: First divergence at 'validator'
  3 of 4 nodes compared
  1 content diff, 1 status diff
```

### Rich (`--rich`)

The rich output includes:

- **Verdict Card** — highlights the first divergence node with status
- **Pipeline Tree** — visual node-by-node comparison with colored icons:
  - Green checkmark for matches
  - Yellow warning for content differences
  - Red cross for status differences
- **Footer** with summary statistics

### JSON (`--json`)

```json
{
  "good_run": "run_good",
  "bad_run": "run_bad",
  "threshold": 0.9,
  "verdict": {
    "node_id": "validator",
    "type": "content_diff",
    "similarity": 0.72
  },
  "nodes": [
    {
      "node_id": "planner",
      "status": "match",
      "status_good": "completed",
      "status_bad": "completed",
      "similarity": 1.0
    },
    {
      "node_id": "researcher",
      "status": "match",
      "status_good": "completed",
      "status_bad": "completed",
      "similarity": 0.98
    },
    {
      "node_id": "validator",
      "status": "content_diff",
      "status_good": "completed",
      "status_bad": "completed",
      "similarity": 0.72
    },
    {
      "node_id": "summarizer",
      "status": "status_diff",
      "status_good": "completed",
      "status_bad": "failed"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Node Comparison Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `match` | Same status and content similarity above threshold |
| `content_diff` | Same status but content similarity below threshold |
| `status_diff` | Different execution status (e.g., completed vs failed) |

## Use Cases

### Debugging a Regression

After a workflow that was working starts failing:

```bash
# Find the last good run and the failing run
binex bisect run_last_good run_failing
```

The verdict tells you exactly which node started behaving differently.

### Comparing Model Swaps

After replaying a run with a different model:

```bash
binex replay run_original --from summarizer --agent summarizer=llm://anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
# Produces run_new

binex bisect run_original run_new --diff
```

The `--diff` flag shows exactly how the output content changed.

### CI Regression Detection

```bash
RESULT=$(binex bisect "$BASELINE_RUN" "$CURRENT_RUN" --json)
VERDICT_TYPE=$(echo "$RESULT" | jq -r '.verdict.type')

if [ "$VERDICT_TYPE" = "status_diff" ]; then
  echo "Status regression detected"
  exit 1
fi
```

## Tips

- Put the "known good" run first and the "bad" run second — the output labels use these terms.
- Use `--threshold 0.95` for stricter comparison when outputs should be nearly identical.
- Use `--threshold 0.5` for looser comparison when you only care about major changes.
- Combine with `binex debug` to inspect the divergent node in detail.

## `binex bisect history`

Binary-search git history for the commit that broke pipeline quality — a `git bisect run` for agent workflows.

Binex owns the workflow spec *and* the launch, so given "quality dropped sometime this week" it can walk the commit history, re-run the workflow at each probe commit, and identify the offending commit. Each probe runs in an isolated **git worktree**, so your working tree and `HEAD` are never touched.

### Synopsis

```
binex bisect history -w <WORKFLOW> --good <REF> --bad <REF> [OPTIONS]
```

### How it works

1. Resolves `--good` / `--bad` to commits (a git ref, or a **run ID** — resolved to the commit that run recorded, see [`binex debug`](debug.md) `git_sha`).
2. Lists commits on the good→bad ancestry path.
3. Binary-searches them: at each probe it checks the commit out in a temporary worktree and runs the workflow **as it existed at that commit**, judging pass/fail with the same criterion as [`binex eval`](eval.md) — the workflow's own assertions, plus an optional `--baseline` diff.
4. Reports the first bad commit. A commit whose workflow file is missing, or that can't be evaluated, is **skipped** (never falsely blamed).

Node caching ([`binex run --cache`](run.md)) makes this affordable: typically one prompt changed per commit, so only affected nodes re-execute.

### Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `-w, --workflow` | path | required | Workflow file to run at each probed commit |
| `--good` | ref/run | required | Known-good commit/ref, or a run ID |
| `--bad` | ref/run | required | Known-bad commit/ref, or a run ID |
| `--var KEY=VALUE` | string | — | Variable substitution (repeatable) |
| `--baseline RUN_ID` | string | — | Golden run for a diff criterion (else assertions only) |
| `--min-similarity` | float | `1.0` | Content-similarity floor when `--baseline` is used |
| `--max-latency-delta-ms` | float | — | Latency-growth ceiling when `--baseline` is used |
| `--max-cost-delta` | float | — | Cost-growth ceiling when `--baseline` is used |
| `--json` | flag | false | Machine-readable output |

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | A bad commit was found |
| 1 | No bad commit found, or indeterminate (too many commits skipped) |
| 2 | Setup error (not a repo, unknown ref, bad range) |

### Example

```bash
binex bisect history -w flow.yaml --good v1.0 --bad HEAD
```

```
  probe 858ac92257e9: bad — n1: assertion failed: contains='...'
  probe 922df37a181c: good — eval passed
Tested 2 commit(s), 0 skipped.

✗ First bad commit: 858ac92257e978dc65ca9072e6f585aac5824a98
  n1: assertion failed: contains='...'

Tip: run 'binex bisect <good_run> <bad_run>' to locate the offending node within that commit.
