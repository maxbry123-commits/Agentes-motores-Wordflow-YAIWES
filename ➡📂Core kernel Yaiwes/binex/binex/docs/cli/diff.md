# binex diff

## Synopsis

```
binex diff RUN_A RUN_B [OPTIONS]
```

## Description

Compare two runs side-by-side. For each node in the workflow, `binex diff` reports:

- **Status changes** -- did a node go from `failed` to `completed` (or vice versa)?
- **Latency delta** -- how much faster or slower was each node?
- **Agent changes** -- was a different agent used (e.g., after a `--agent` swap in replay)?
- **Artifact changes** -- did the output content differ between the two runs?
- **Error resolution** -- was an error introduced or resolved?

The comparison is keyed by `task_id`, so nodes that exist in only one run are shown with `-` for the missing side.

Exits `0` on success. Exits `1` if either run ID is not found.

## Options

| Option | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `RUN_A` | `string` | First run ID (the "baseline") |
| `RUN_B` | `string` | Second run ID (the "comparison") |
| `--json-output` / `--json` | flag | Output as a structured JSON object |
| `--rich` / `--no-rich` | flag | Enable or disable rich table output. Auto-detected by default (enabled if `rich` is installed) |
| `--semantic` | flag | Analyze *meaningful vs cosmetic* changes with a model (opt-in, spends tokens) |
| `--semantic-model` | string | Model for `--semantic` (default: `$BINEX_JUDGE_MODEL` or a cheap default; use e.g. `ollama/llama3` for fully local) |
| `--yes` / `-y` | flag | Skip the cost-confirmation prompt for `--semantic` |

## Semantic diff (`--semantic`)

Line-based diff of two LLM outputs is nearly useless — the texts always differ. `--semantic` distinguishes **"reworded the same answer"** from **"the answer actually changed"**.

For each node whose content differs, a cheap model is asked **narrow, targeted questions** (rather than one vague "did the meaning change"):

- **structure** — did the data structure / JSON schema change (fields, types)?
- **facts** — did any factual claim, number, name, or conclusion change?
- **tone_format** — did only the wording/tone/formatting change while the substance stayed the same?

A node is flagged **meaningful** (⚠) when *structure* or *facts* changed; a *tone_format*-only change is collapsed as **cosmetic**. Each verdict carries a per-question **confidence** (high/medium/low), and the judge runs at **temperature 0** so a verdict is stable rather than a coin-flip.

### Opt-in and cost-transparent

This is the first feature where Binex spends *your* tokens, so it is never automatic:

- It runs only when you pass `--semantic`.
- Before any model call, it prints an **estimate** — number of judge calls, token count, and dollar cost on the chosen model — and asks you to confirm. `--yes` skips the prompt for scripts.
- The judge model is configurable; point `--semantic-model` at a local Ollama model for a fully no-cloud run (cost shown as free).
- A judge error or unparseable reply **fails safe** — the aspect is conservatively reported as *changed*, never silently collapsed.

```
$ binex diff run_a run_b --semantic
Semantic analysis: 2 judge call(s) on 'gpt-4o-mini', ~1400 tokens, estimated cost ~$0.0006.
Proceed? [y/N]: y
... textual diff ...

Semantic analysis
  ⚠ validator: meaningful change: facts
      - facts: changed (high) — validated count 9 → 5
  · summarizer: cosmetic only (reworded/reformatted, same substance)
      - tone_format: changed (high) — reordered sentences
```

With `--json`, a `semantic` array is added to the output, one entry per changed node with `meaningful`, `summary`, and per-question `changed`/`confidence`/`reason`.

## Plain Text Output

When `rich` is not installed (or `--no-rich` is passed), the output is a compact text diff:

```
$ binex diff run_a1b2c3d4 run_e5f6a7b8

Comparing: run_a1b2c3d4 vs run_e5f6a7b8
Workflow: content-pipeline
Status: failed vs completed

  fetch_data: (no changes)
  transform:
    status: failed -> completed
    latency: 2340ms -> 1870ms (-470ms)
    artifacts: CHANGED
  summarize:
    status: failed -> completed
    agent: llm://openai/gpt-4o -> llm://anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
    latency: 4520ms -> 3100ms (-1420ms)
    artifacts: CHANGED
  format_output: (no changes)
```

Each node is listed with its changes. Nodes with no differences show `(no changes)`.

The latency delta is shown in parentheses with a `+` or `-` sign indicating whether the node became slower or faster.

## Rich Output

When `rich` is installed (default), or with `--rich`, the output is a formatted table with color coding:

- **Green** status = `completed`
- **Red** status = `failed`
- **Yellow** row highlight = status changed between runs
- **Green latency delta** = node got faster
- **Red latency delta** = node got slower

```
$ binex diff run_a1b2c3d4 run_e5f6a7b8

To force plain text output even when `rich` is installed:

```bash
binex diff run_a1b2c3d4 run_e5f6a7b8 --no-rich
```

## JSON Output

The `--json` flag outputs the full structured diff, suitable for programmatic consumption or piping into `jq`:

```bash
$ binex diff run_a1b2c3d4 run_e5f6a7b8 --json
```

```json
{
  "run_a": "run_a1b2c3d4",
  "run_b": "run_e5f6a7b8",

    {

      "error_b": null
    },
    {
      "task_id": "transform",

      "status_a": "completed",
      "status_b": "completed",
      "status_changed": false,

      "agent_changed": false,
      "artifacts_changed": false,
      "error_a": null,
      "error_b": null
    }
  ]
}
```

You can extract specific fields with `jq`:

```bash
# Show only nodes where status changed
binex diff run_a1b2c3d4 run_e5f6a7b8 --json | jq '.steps[] | select(.status_changed)'

# Show only nodes where artifacts differ
binex diff run_a1b2c3d4 run_e5f6a7b8 --json | jq '.steps[] | select(.artifacts_changed) | .task_id'
```

## Error Handling

If either run ID does not exist in the store, the command exits with code `1`:

```
$ binex diff run_nonexistent run_e5f6a7b8
Error: Run 'run_nonexistent' not found
```

## Use Cases

### Comparing a Failed Run vs Successful Re-Run

After a run fails, you might fix the issue (update an API key, adjust a prompt, increase `max_tokens`) and re-run the same workflow. Use `diff` to confirm which nodes were affected:

```bash
# Original run failed at the summarize step
binex run workflows/report.yaml --var topic="Q4 earnings"
# Run ID: run_f8e7d6c5  Status: failed

# Fix the prompt and re-run
binex run workflows/report.yaml --var topic="Q4 earnings"
# Run ID: run_a9b8c7d6  Status: completed

# Compare to see what changed
binex diff run_f8e7d6c5 run_a9b8c7d6
```

### Comparing Runs with Different LLM Providers

Use `binex replay` with agent swaps, then `diff` to see how a different model performs:

```bash
# Replay with a different model
binex replay run_a1b2c3d4 \
  --from summarize \
  --workflow workflows/report.yaml \
  --agent summarize=llm://anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514

# Replay produced run_x9y8z7w6 — now compare
binex diff run_a1b2c3d4 run_x9y8z7w6
```

The diff will show `agent_changed: true` for the `summarize` node, along with any differences in output content and latency.

### Scripting with JSON Output

Use `--json` in CI pipelines to detect regressions:

```bash
# Fail CI if any node changed status from completed to failed
REGRESSIONS=$(binex diff "$BASELINE_RUN" "$CURRENT_RUN" --json \
  | jq '[.steps[] | select(.status_a == "completed" and .status_b == "failed")] | length')

if [ "$REGRESSIONS" -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "Regression detected: $REGRESSIONS nodes failed"
  exit 1
fi
```

## Tips

- Run A is the "baseline" and Run B is the "comparison". Put the older/reference run first.
- The diff compares artifact **content**, not artifact IDs. Two runs producing identical text from different artifact IDs will show `artifacts_changed: false`.
- Nodes that exist in only one run (e.g., workflow was modified between runs) will show `-` for the missing side's status and latency.
- Combine with `binex debug` to investigate specific nodes flagged by the diff.
