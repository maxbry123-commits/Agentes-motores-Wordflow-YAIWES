"""Runners: let a **real agent** use the tree that is being evolved.

:data:`~agentdescent.evolution.Run` is ``(rendered, task) -> output``, and for a
text artifact that is enough -- the instruction goes in the prompt. A directory
cannot: a skill directory is only a skill directory if the agent can *read the
files*, which means the candidate has to exist on disk, in the layout the agent
expects, for the duration of one rollout.

That is what a runner does:

    parse the rendered tree -> materialise it into a fresh workspace
    -> overlay the pristine frozen files -> stage the task's fixtures
    -> run the agent bound to that directory -> clean up

**One workspace per call, always.** ``evolve(max_concurrency=N)`` runs workers in
threads and ``EvolvingArtifact.score`` opens its own pool of ``eval_concurrency``
threads, so a shared directory would let two candidates overwrite each other --
producing scores that look perfectly ordinary and are simply wrong.

The overlay is the other half of ``FileTree(frozen=...)``. Filtering proposals
stops a reflector from *editing* the test suite; it does nothing about candidate
code that rewrites ``conftest.py`` at run time. Writing the pristine copies back
over the candidate, after it has been materialised, is what makes "frozen"
a property of every rollout rather than a property of well-behaved proposals.
