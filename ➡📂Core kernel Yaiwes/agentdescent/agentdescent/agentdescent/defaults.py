"""The shipped evolution algorithm, as replaceable pieces.

`agentdescent/policies.py` says what a decision *is*; this module is the one the
engine makes by default. Splitting them is what makes "use a different accept
rule" a parameter rather than a rewrite of `Aggregator`.

Every class here is the code that used to live inside `Aggregator._process` and
its neighbours, moved and not rewritten. That is deliberate to the point of
pedantry: each of those rules has a history -- the conflict loop keeps going
after a win because stopping at the first one left mutually contradicting cards
behind, the regression guard reads the full held-out set because reading the
cheap layer made it judge quality from a sub-sample -- and a rewrite is how a
codebase forgets things it has already paid to learn.

The one thing that is new is `AcceptancePolicy` taking a `MergeContext` instead
of reaching into the aggregator's state. That is what lets a replacement be
written without importing `Aggregator` at all.

class DefaultFusion:
    """Build the union of complementary diffs and hand it to the gate.

    With ``tournament=True`` it instead ranks every candidate *and* their fusion
    on the cheap layer first, and puts the winner forward.

    **Why ranking is not the default.** Work out what the tournament decides
    that the acceptance gate does not, and it is one cell:

    ==========================================  ===============  ===============
    case                                        union -> gate    tournament
    ==========================================  ===============  ===============
    fusion worse than the artifact              gate rejects     rejected
    fusion better than every single             fusion commits   fusion commits
    fusion beats the artifact, loses to a       fusion commits   that single
    single                                                       commits
    ==========================================  ===============  ===============

    So the tournament is a *selection* refinement, not a safety mechanism: the
    gate already scores the candidate on the **full** held-out set and stops a
    regression. And the one cell it changes is recoverable, because
    :func:`~agentdescent.aggregator.fuse_diffs` is ``ops.update()`` -- the union
    is a **superset** of every single, so committing it loses no proposal, it
    merely carries some that looked negative this round. The next round proposes
    from there.

    Against that: the ranking is paid every round, unconditionally, at one cheap
    sweep per candidate. An unconditional cost for a conditional, recoverable
    gain is the wrong default.

    It stays available because it is the **only** instrument that can answer
    "does merging just average the improvements away?" -- `best_single_score`
    exists only when a single was actually scored. The win rate is a property of
    the workload rather than of the mechanism, so this is a per-workload
    measurement to run deliberately, not a tax on every run. See
    :meth:`EvolutionResult.fusion_stats` and ``docs/aggregator.md``.

    Note where the remaining cost goes. Once :class:`DefaultConflict` has run,
    the surviving diffs are pairwise non-contradicting, so the union always
    builds and this policy spends **nothing**. Ranking that genuinely has to
    happen -- choosing between two diffs that contradict -- happens there, which
    is where a choice is unavoidable.
