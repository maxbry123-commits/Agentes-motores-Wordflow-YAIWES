"""The seam between *the algorithm* and *the machinery that runs it*.

`evolve()` already had nine replaceable pieces -- the actors, the strategy, the
parallel plan, the task sampler, the staleness policy, the aggregator factory.
What it did not have was any way to replace one *decision* without replacing the
whole optimizer: acceptance, conflict resolution, fusion and promotion all live
inside a single 150-line method, so "I want a different accept rule" meant
reimplementing `Aggregator`.

This module is the contract for those decisions, and nothing else. It holds
`Protocol` definitions and the small frozen records they exchange; the default
implementations stay exactly where they are today. Two consequences worth being
explicit about:

**Protocols, not base classes.** `typing.Protocol` is structural, so
`ThreeLayerVerifier`, `Ledger` and `Aggregator` satisfy these contracts without
inheriting anything and without a line changing. An ABC would have required
edits to all three, which is a behaviour change dressed as a definition.

**Written from the call sites, not from the docs.** `docs/verifier.md` once
described `ThreeLayerVerifier` as three methods, having missed `learned_eval`;
a verifier written against that page raises `AttributeError` half an hour into a
run, not at startup. So every method here comes from grepping what the engine and
the aggregator actually call -- and `tests/test_policy_contract.py` re-derives
those sets and fails if this file drifts from them.

That rule already earned its keep: writing `LedgerProtocol` from the aggregator's
four calls would have shipped a contract that omits `register`, `close` and
`log`, which the *engine* calls -- so the first injected ledger would have died
in `_build_engine`.

What is *not* here: sandbox provisioning, executors, worker pools. Those are the
execution and resource planes; the algorithm is not allowed to know about them,
which is what keeps a run reproducible when it moves to another machine.
