"""Agentic backends -- a base agent that *navigates documents with tools*, not
just maps a prompt to text.

:data:`agentdescent.agents.Completion` is ``prompt -> text``. That is enough for
ACE/GEPA/SkillOpt (fixed prompt in, answer out), but not for EvoSkill's OfficeQA:
the answer is a figure buried in a 200 KB - 1.2 MB financial table that often has
to be **found by grep and then computed** (e.g. summing the monthly "national
defense" rows for a calendar year). A single completion cannot do that; an
*agent with tools* can.

This module adds that abstraction:

    AgentBackend.answer(question, document, skills="") -> str

with two implementations:

* :func:`openhands_backend` -- runs a **real OpenHands agent** (OpenHands SDK
  v1.x) with ``terminal`` + ``file_editor`` tools over the document, driven by any
  LiteLLM-supported model. Point it at DeepSeek with ``model="openai/deepseek-v4-pro"``
  and ``base_url="https://api.deepseek.com"``. Requires ``pip install openhands-ai``
  (Python >= 3.12). No Docker needed (local runtime).
* :func:`tool_loop_backend` -- a dependency-free ``grep``/``read`` ReAct loop over
  the document using any :data:`~agentdescent.agents.Completion`. A lighter local
  stand-in that mirrors what OpenHands does; runs anywhere.

Both return a plain answer string, so they slot in wherever a base agent is
needed (see ``examples/evoskill/evoskill_skill_discovery.py --backend openhands``).
