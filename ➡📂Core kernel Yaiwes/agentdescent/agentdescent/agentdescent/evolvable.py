"""Core data model for AgentDescent.

This module defines the *unit of evolution* (``Evolvable``) and the two
"gradient-like" objects that flow through the system:

* :class:`Diff` -- a proposed change to one or more artifacts (the "gradient").
* :class:`EvidenceCard` -- the metadata attached to a diff (the "gradient
  metadata"): what versions it was derived against, the trajectories that
  justify it, and the locally-measured before/after delta.

The central analogy of the framework (design doc, section 1) is:

    parameter tensor θ            -> library of Evolvable artifacts
    gradient g                    -> Diff + EvidenceCard
    version vector on a diff      -> the base_version it was read against

Everything here is provider-agnostic: an ``Evolvable`` can be a skill, a prompt
template, a harness module, or a learned verifier.  What evolves is decided by
*registration*, not hard-coded (design doc, section 3.2).
