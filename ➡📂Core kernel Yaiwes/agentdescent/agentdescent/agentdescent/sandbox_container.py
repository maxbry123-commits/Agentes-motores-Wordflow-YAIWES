"""A sandbox that is actually a boundary.

`sandbox.py` manages *lifetime*: how many workspaces exist, who owns one, who
cleans up when an owner dies. It does not manage *isolation*, and its only
provider does not provide any: `HOME` and `TMPDIR` point inside the workspace,
which redirects a lookup but not a path. Model-authored code that opens
`/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa` gets it, and can post it anywhere, because nothing about
a trimmed environment restricts the filesystem or the network.

This provider runs the candidate inside a container instead. What changes:

    filesystem   only the workspace is visible; the host's is not
    network      off unless the spec asks for it
    privileges   no capabilities, no new privileges, not root
    resources    memory and CPU ceilings on every platform, not just POSIX

What does not change: containers share the host kernel, and escapes exist. This
is much stronger than a trimmed environment and it is **not** a licence to run
deliberately hostile code.

**Why the CLI rather than a Python SDK.** The core of this package has no
dependencies, and an SDK would make container support a Python dependency
instead of a machine one. The CLI also gets `podman` for free -- its interface is
docker-compatible -- and the only output that has to be parsed is a container id
and one column of `ps`.

**Why the command runner is injectable.** Nearly all of the logic here *is* the
command: which flags, in what order, with what defaults. That can be asserted
exactly, on a machine with no container engine at all, which is the difference
between "this provider was tested" and "this provider was run once". The parts
that need a real engine are tested separately and skipped when there is none.
