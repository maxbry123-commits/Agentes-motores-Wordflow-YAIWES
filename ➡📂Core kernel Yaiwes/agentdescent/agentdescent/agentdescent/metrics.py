"""What a run cost, measured at the places the engine already funnels through.

A run used to report *what* it produced and nothing about what it took to get
there. `EvolutionResult` carried the artifact, the per-round reward and the merge
categories; a refactor that doubled the wall-clock and tripled the model calls
left every one of those numbers untouched, which makes "did this change make
things worse?" unanswerable from the result object alone.

The five questions this module exists to answer -- time to a quality bar, cost to
that bar, how much of the pipeline was stale, how much was recomputed, and how
much was spent waiting on a sandbox rather than on a model -- all decompose into
counters. So this is counters, and deliberately nothing else: no formatting, no
export, no sampling. `Meter` is written from every worker thread and the merger
thread at once, which is the only reason it is more than a dataclass.

**Sum, not wall-clock.** ``rollout_seconds`` adds up per-rollout durations across
concurrent workers, so with N workers it routinely exceeds ``wallclock``. It is
the answer to "how much rollout was there", not "how long did rollouts take"; a
reader who takes it as the latter computes occupancy above 100%.

**Model time and sandbox time are separate on purpose.** Both look identical in a
total wall-clock, and telling them apart is the whole point of the sandbox
counters: "8 workers only bought 2x" reads as a staleness problem, a slow model
and a queue of containers installing dependencies, and those need opposite fixes.

**Three counters are wall-clock on one thread, not sums.** ``merge_seconds`` and
``merge_gate_seconds`` are measured on the single merger (or, synchronously, the
single driver), so they are directly comparable against ``elapsed_s`` -- and
``merge_gate_seconds`` is a *subset* of ``merge_seconds``, not a term to add to
it. ``worker_starved_seconds`` is a sum across workers like
``rollout_seconds``. Together they answer the one question none of the others
can: **did the gate stop anyone from working?** ``eval_seconds`` cannot, because
it sums across the evaluation pool -- eight threads scoring for one second each
is 8.0 there whether the run had eight seconds of gate or one.
