"""Mechanism microport: **PromptBreeder** (arXiv:2309.16797, no released code).

Algorithm 1, as written. A population of ``N`` units, each holding a task-prompt
and a mutation-prompt; a binary tournament that samples two units uniformly,
scores both on a **random batch of training data**, mutates the winner with an
operator **sampled uniformly from all nine**, and **replaces the loser** with the
result; the highest-fitness unit is returned.

Three pieces of that were missing and are now here, because each changes the
search rather than the bookkeeping:

* **Replacement.** The population was an archive that only grew, so no unit ever
  died and the selection pressure the replacement step creates was absent.
  :class:`~examples.promptbreeder._promptbreeder_population.PromptBreederPopulation`
  keeps ``|P| = N`` and overwrites the last tournament's loser.
* **Fitness on a random training batch.** The tournament ranked on the held-out
  split -- the acceptance gate's own signal, which makes the tournament a second
  gate rather than a fitness measure. It now scores a random batch of the
  training split, resampled per tournament, as the paper does.
* **All nine operators, sampled uniformly.** Three ran in fixed rotation.
  Rotation guarantees each operator's share and sampling does not, so a run's
  operator mix was an assumption rather than an observation; the mix is now
  reported.

Initialisation is the paper's too: ``N`` units, each the problem description
mutated by a mutation-prompt and a thinking-style drawn from hand-designed sets.

The population lives in the engine's ``aggregator_factory`` seam, and the genome
is a :class:`~examples._method_policy.FieldSlots` artifact, so the two prompts
are separate plain-text ledger keys -- edits to different fields union-merge, and
contested fields are model-merged, which is the paper's *prompt crossover*
arriving through the merge layer.

Boundaries: the population is budget-sized rather than the paper's 50 units and
the fitness batch is 4 items rather than its 100; the unit carries no few-shot
context, so context shuffling is expressed as prompt crossover over the
population rather than over exemplars.
