"""PromptBreeder's nine mutation operators (arXiv:2309.16797, Section 3).

The paper groups them into five classes and **samples one uniformly at random
per replication event**. All nine are here; what each needs beyond the unit
itself is noted, because that is what decides whether an operator is
implementable at all:

===========================  =========================  =====================
class / operator             needs                      status
===========================  =========================  =====================
Direct: zero-order           problem description        implemented
Direct: first-order          the unit                   implemented
EDA: eda                     the population             implemented
EDA: eda_rank_index          the population, by fitness implemented
EDA: lineage                 the elite history          implemented
Hyper: zero_order_hyper      a thinking-style           implemented (two-step)
Hyper: first_order_hyper     the hyper-mutation-prompt  implemented (two-step)
Lamarckian: working_out      a *correct* rollout        implemented
Crossover + shuffle          the population, few-shot   implemented
===========================  =========================  =====================

**Both hypermutation operators are two-step**, and that is not a detail. The
paper generates a new mutation-prompt and then *applies it to the task-prompt*;
an implementation that stops after the first step produces a candidate whose
task-prompt is unchanged, so it cannot move the score at all. Measured here: one
seed spent 20 of its 80 draws on `first_order_hyper` and 9 more on
`zero_order_hyper`, i.e. over a third of its budget on candidates that could not
by construction improve anything, and finished at 0.000.

The Lamarckian operator is the one that looks impossible on a benchmark with no
few-shot slot, and is not: this port's ``solve`` output *is* a working-out, and
the engine hands ``propose`` the rollout's own output and reward. When the
reward is 1.0 that output is a correct working-out, which is exactly the
operator's input. When it is not, the operator has nothing to reverse-engineer
and the sampler draws again -- stated here rather than silently degraded to a
first-order mutation.
