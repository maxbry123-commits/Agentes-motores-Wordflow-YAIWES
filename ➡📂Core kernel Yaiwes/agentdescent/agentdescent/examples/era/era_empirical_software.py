"""ERA empirical-software search, ported onto the AgentDescent engine.

Upstream reference
------------------
Repository: https://github.com/google-research/era
Commit: b836730b5c000526af95116b1d0e2c60c8cf0a10
Example: implementation/playground_s3e1.py, on implementation/futs.py

Preserved from that revision:

* Flat UCB tree search: every node is selectable, the exploitation term is a
  normalised rank rather than a raw score, and the prior is uniform.
* `puct = rank_score + c_puct * (1/N) * sqrt(total_visits) / (1 + visits)`,
  with visits backpropagated up the parent chain and `c_puct = 1.0`.
* A node is appended for every expansion, including one whose program failed --
  a failure scores `-inf`, it does not vanish.
* The Kaggle Playground S3E1 regression task, its 80/20 head/tail split, its
  `train_and_predict(train_path, test_path)` contract, RMSE, and the mutation
  prompt with its four speed constraints.

Intentional differences:

* Upstream ships **no sandbox** -- `sandbox.py` is an abstract class whose
  `run` raises "Must provide a sandbox for executing untrusted code". This port
  supplies one (Bubblewrap on Linux, Seatbelt on macOS) plus an AST gate, and
  says plainly that with scikit-learn on the allowlist the sandbox, not the
  gate, is the boundary.
* Upstream scores its whole 20% tail and reports that same number. Here the
  tail is cut into shards and the last few are never shown to the search, so
  the reported figure is on rows the optimiser could not see.
* AgentDescent supplies workers, the ledger, evidence cards, staleness handling,
  and the barrier-free runtime. `futs.search`'s loop body therefore becomes a
  Strategy plus an Aggregator, and its selection rule is the shipped
  `selection.FlatPuct`.
* Upstream is serial. With N workers in flight, a visit is reserved at
  *selection* time instead of after execution -- which is what the serial loop
  would have seen had those expansions already been dispatched, and is
  identical to upstream at one worker.
* The loop is parameterised by a :class:`~examples.era._era_domain.Domain` so a
  second ERA task can run on it without a second copy of `futs.search`.
  :func:`s3e1_domain` is the default and is upstream's task;
  `era_hard_integrals.py` supplies the other one. Nothing about the search
  differs between them -- the domain carries the seed program, the evaluator,
  the prompt and the name of the metric, and that is all.
