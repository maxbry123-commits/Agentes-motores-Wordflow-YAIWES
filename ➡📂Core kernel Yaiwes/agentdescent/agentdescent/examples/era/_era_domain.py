"""What a task has to supply for the ERA tree search to run on it.

`futs.search` is indifferent to what it is searching over: it ranks nodes by a
score it never interprets, expands the one PUCT picks, and appends whatever
comes back. Upstream demonstrates that on one task and hard-codes it; this
struct is the seam that keeps the loop honest across two.

Nothing algorithmic lives here. A :class:`Domain` is the four things the search
cannot invent -- the program it starts from, the way a program is scored, the
prompt that rewrites one, and the name of the number being reported -- and
`era_empirical_software.py` holds everything else.

The default, :func:`~examples.era.era_empirical_software.s3e1_domain`, is the
upstream Kaggle task, so a port that names no domain is the port upstream ships.
