"""Sandbox-side runner for the ERA LLM-SRBench task.

Executed inside Bubblewrap or Seatbelt, exactly like ``_era_runner.py`` and
``_era_integration_runner.py`` next door, with the same contract: one JSON
object on stdout, the candidate's own prints redirected into a buffer, and one
failed problem never taking the shard down.

Two things differ from the sibling runners, and both come from what a
*symbolic-regression* candidate is being asked to do:

* **It imports numpy.** The other two are standard library only. This one hands
  the candidate float64 arrays and scores an expression against held-out ones,
  and re-implementing that on lists would be a second, slower copy of the thing
  every candidate here already depends on.
* **The held-out samples are opened after ``discover`` returns.** The candidate
  is given the training arrays and nothing else; the test and OOD arrays are
  read from the shard's ``.npz`` once its answer is in hand.

  In ``--answer-format expression`` -- this port's own tightening -- that answer
  is a formula, interpreted by a validated AST walker, so there is no point at
  which candidate code and held-out data are both live. In
  ``--answer-format program``, the benchmark's own format, the answer *is* code
  and it runs on the held-out **inputs** (never the targets), exactly as
  upstream's `lambda_fn(X_id)` does. That is the price of comparability and it
  is stated rather than hidden; the sandbox is the boundary in both cases.

The per-problem wall-clock is enforced here rather than trusted to the
candidate, with ``SIGALRM``: a method that ignores its budget on one problem
would otherwise spend the whole shard's timeout there and every remaining
problem would score zero for its neighbour's fault.
