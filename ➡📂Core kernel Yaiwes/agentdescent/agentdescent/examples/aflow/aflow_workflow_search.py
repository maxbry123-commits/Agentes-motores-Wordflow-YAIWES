"""Mechanism microport: **AFlow** (FoundationAgents/AFlow@3f457218, ICLR 2025).

Preserved: the *actual* selection rule at the pinned revision -- **soft mixed
probability**, ``λ·uniform + (1−λ)·softmax(α·(s−s_max))`` over the top-k scored
workflows (`data_utils.select_round`; it is not UCT and keeps no visit counts) --
and expansion prompts carrying the selected parent's **experience**: its score,
and every modification already tried from it with whether it helped, which is
upstream's ``experience.json`` and its ``format_experience``.

**The scores are scaled by 100 before the softmax**, exactly as
``select_round`` does, and that single line is the difference between AFlow and
a coin flip. Upstream's α is 0.2 *against percentages*, so the effective
temperature is 20 against accuracies in ``[0, 1]``. Without the scaling, on a
pool scoring 0.50 / 0.40 / 0.25 / 0.10 the pick distribution is
``[0.265, 0.257, 0.245, 0.233]`` -- uniform to three digits -- where upstream's
is ``[0.688, 0.158, 0.079, 0.075]``. A port missing it still runs, still reports
"soft mixed probability", and has no exploitation at all.

``α = 0.2`` and ``λ = 0.3`` are the pinned code's own defaults
(``DataUtils.DEFAULT_ALPHA`` / ``DEFAULT_LAMBDA``), not the paper's 0.4 / 0.2.
Where the released code and the paper disagree about a constant, the code is what
produced the published numbers.

The workflow is a :class:`~examples._method_policy.FieldSlots` artifact (solve
node, review node, modification note), so field edits union-merge and contested
fields are model-merged without ranking evaluations.

Boundaries: two fixed model nodes instead of code-level graph rewrites; search
depth is the candidate budget instead of 20 rounds; upstream regenerates
*without bound* until the proposed modification is one it has not tried from
that parent, and this retries once.
