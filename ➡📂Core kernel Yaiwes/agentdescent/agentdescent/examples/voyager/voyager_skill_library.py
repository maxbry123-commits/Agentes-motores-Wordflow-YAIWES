"""Environment analogue: **Voyager** (MineDojo/Voyager@55e45a88).

Preserved: a skill is added **only when the critic says the task succeeded**
(`voyager.py`: ``if info["success"]: self.skill_manager.add_new_skill(info)``);
repair driven by **environment feedback** -- the deterministic world executes
the attempt and reports the first failed step, which is what the repair prompt
sees (never a gold trace); the **critic** as the engine's worker self-check
(`self_verify`): every proposal is re-rolled and judged by the environment
reward before it reaches the gate, upstream's "judge success from the
environment, not the agent's claim"; and frontier task focus via the
:class:`~agentdescent.sampling.DifficultyWeighted` sampler.

**The library is not add-only, and this port used to say it was.**
`SkillManager.add_new_skill` prints *"Skill {name} already exists. Rewriting!"*,
deletes the vector-store entry and reassigns ``self.skills[program_name]``. The
older code is dumped to disk as ``{name}V2.js`` and **retrieval never reads
it**: ``retrieve_skills`` returns ``self.skills[...]["code"]``, so the live
library holds exactly one version per name -- the newest. Versioned-on-disk and
overwritten-in-memory are different libraries, and only the second one is the
algorithm. Each goal key here therefore holds the latest accepted skill rather
than an accumulation.

Boundaries: a deterministic crafting world replaces Minecraft; key-match
retrieval replaces embedding retrieval over descriptions (``retrieval_top_k=5``,
so upstream shows the action agent several skills and this shows one); the task
pool plus difficulty sampling is an analogue of the generative curriculum, which
proposes novel tasks.
