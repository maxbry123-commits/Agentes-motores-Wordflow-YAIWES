"""The single runner behind every MethodPolicy port.

This is the only module that touches the execution plane: it owns the recorder,
phase naming, budgets, mode dispatch, and the merge configuration. A
:class:`~examples._method_policy.MethodPolicy` supplies everything else.

Merging is configured for **model-merged unions instead of ranking**: batches
are sized to the worker count and, for text-valued artifacts,
:func:`agentdescent.fusion.reflective_merge` is installed so contradicting
proposals are synthesised by one model call and gated by one held-out
evaluation -- rather than each candidate paying its own ranking evaluation.

#: detail -- the budget bounds both how far a worker's snapshot may drift behind
#: head and how many cards may sit un-merged ahead of the merger. Fifteen rows in
