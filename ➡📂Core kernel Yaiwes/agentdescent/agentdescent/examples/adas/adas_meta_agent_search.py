"""Harness self-evolution, faithful port: **ADAS -- Meta Agent Search**.

Paper : "Automated Design of Agentic Systems", Shengran Hu, Cong Lu, Jeff Clune,
        2024 (arXiv:2408.08435; ICLR 2025).
Repo  : https://github.com/ShengranHu/ADAS
Dataset: **MGSM** (Multilingual Grade-School Math), the light math benchmark
        ADAS searches on (`dataset/mgsm/*.tsv`; Shi et al., 2022).

Where ACE/GEPA evolve a *skill* (an L2 prompt/context), ADAS evolves the
**agentic system itself** -- the control flow that orchestrates the model. That
is a **harness** change: high blast radius -> AgentDescent's **L1** governance
layer (`classify()` below prints the layer). It runs **through `evolve()`** like
ACE/GEPA: an `AgentDesignStrategy` turns a proposed agent (JSON) into a `Diff`,
and a custom `aggregator_factory` (`MetaSearchAggregator`) is the keep-all
archive with bootstrap-CI fitness. Meta Agent Search is the loop:

    1. seed an ARCHIVE with hand-designed building blocks (CoT, Self-Consistency,
       Reflexion, Debate, Step-back, Quality-Diversity, Role-Assignment);
    2. a META-AGENT, conditioned on the *entire archive* (designs + fitness),
       proposes the next agent as a structured program, then does two Reflexion
       refinement rounds;
    3. EVALUATE it on the MGSM validation set; fitness = bootstrap-CI mean;
    4. **keep-all** append to the archive; repeat. Return the best test fitness.

Faithful-but-safe substitution (documented, not hidden): ADAS represents each
agent as a model-written Python `forward()` that it `exec`s. Executing arbitrary
model code is unsafe, so here an agent is a **composable control-flow program**
in a small, validated DSL (`AGENT_BLOCKS`) run by a safe interpreter. The Meta
Agent Search *loop*, the seed archive, MGSM scoring, and keep-all archive are
faithful; only the agent *substrate* is a safe DSL instead of raw `exec`.

Parent conditioning is pluggable: ADAS conditions the meta-agent on the whole
archive; `--select dgm` instead samples which prior agents to surface using the
**Darwin Godel Machine** rule (Zhang et al., 2025, arXiv:2505.22954):
`p_i proportional to sigmoid(10*(score-0.5)) * 1/(1+children)` -- DGM's own
setting (a self-modifying coding agent on SWE-bench) needs Docker and is out of
scope, but its open-ended selection rule ports directly and is unit-tested.

    python -m examples.adas.adas_meta_agent_search --model claude-haiku-4-5 --generations 6
