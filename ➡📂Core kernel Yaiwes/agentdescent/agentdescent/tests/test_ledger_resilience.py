"""The ledger must not be able to take a run down with it.

The ledger is the third failure category, alongside a caller bug (`ContractError`,
propagate) and a backend blip (absorb and report): it is *infrastructure*. Three
things used to go wrong and each is pinned here.

1. It refused to start at all under an ordinary `~/.gitconfig` -- `commit.gpgsign
   = true` failed the genesis commit, so `evolve()` raised before running a single
   task, from a call that mentions git nowhere.
2. A failure mid-run escaped as an exception, discarding the artifact evolved so
   far -- directly against the documented contract that a run that died still
   returns a partial result. Worst case, the failing call was `ledger.log()`,
   fetched inside the `return` expression purely for the cosmetic `ledger_log`.
3. Scratch repos were reclaimed only at interpreter exit, so a killed process
   leaked one and a long-lived process (a notebook, a sweep) held every repo it
   had ever created.
