"""The audit gate must be reachable, and the cheap layer must be cheap.

Two halves of one mechanism, and both were inert.

**The gate could not open.** `force_oracle` fires on
`blast_radius >= 0.5 or trust < 0.75`, and the only writer of trust --
`update_trust` -- sat *inside* that branch. So for any artifact below 0.5 the
condition could never become true: measured on the default `blast_radius=0.2`,
`oracle_calls_used` was 0 for a whole run and trust stayed pinned at its initial
1.0. An artifact at 0.4 -- which `governance.classify` calls L1, the *slow,
conservative* layer -- got exactly as much oracle scrutiny as an L2 skill: none.

**The layers all computed the same number.** `evolve()` pinned
`rule_subset=len(held_out)` with zero noise, so rule / learned / oracle were one
full held-out sweep wearing three names. The aggregator therefore paid a full
sweep for every candidate it merely wanted to *rank*, and `oracle_budget` capped
nothing -- its documented fallback (`rule_eval`) returned the very value it was
trying to avoid buying.

That second half was fixed twice. `cheap_eval_tasks=` made the sample settable,
and the default stayed at the whole set -- so nothing in `bench/` or `examples/`
ever passed it and every real run kept paying. The default is now 8, which is
`ThreeLayerVerifier.rule_subset`'s own; `evolve()` had been overriding it.
