"""A sandbox is a resource, so it needs an owner, a bound and a way to be reclaimed.

Today a workspace is created inside the `run` closure, deleted by that closure's
`finally`, and reclaimed -- if the process died before the `finally` ran -- by a
sweep over `$TMPDIR` that deletes anything old enough. Each of those three has a
hole, and the first two are reachable on a single machine:

* the `finally` does not run when the thread is abandoned (a round timeout) or
  the process is killed;
* `subprocess.run(timeout=)` kills the process it started and not the ones *that*
  process started, so a timed-out `pytest` or `pip install` leaves children
  behind -- still running, still holding a workspace that has been deleted;
* "old enough" is not "unused": on a shared `$TMPDIR` it can delete a directory
  another live run is still using.

The first test in this file fails against the code as it was written; it is here
first on purpose.
