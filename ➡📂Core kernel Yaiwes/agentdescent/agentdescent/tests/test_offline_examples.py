"""The five examples that run end-to-end with no dependencies, and had no test.

The coverage was inverted: the six algorithm ports, which need credentials to do
anything real, all had offline tests of their pure helpers -- while the five that
run fully offline in seconds had none, and CI runs `pytest` only, so no example
was executed at all.

They produce numbers the docs quote. `run_demo` is the RQ1 result in the README,
`index.md` and `usage.md`; `rq2_staleness` is the RQ2 table. Three of the defects
found in this repo would have been caught here:

* `stable` sat at 0.000 for all 40 rounds of `run_demo` while the docs published a
  table where it caught up at round 8 -- output that code could not produce;
* `rq2_staleness` swept a parameter the run never read, so three of its four
  published rows were the same configuration;
* every sweep reported `dev_acc=1.000` for every setting, so the experiments had
  no dynamic range to report at all.

Each test asserts the *shape of the finding*, not an exact number: these are
seeded but wall-clock-bounded in places, and pinning absolutes would make them
flaky and would encode the machine they were written on.

    This used to assert `guarded.discarded_stale > 0`, and that assertion could
    not hold here. `_async_stats` is an **8-second, wall-clock-bounded run of six
    real worker threads against one merger**, and whether any diff's `eta`
    exceeds alpha depends on whether the merger drains slower than the workers
    fill -- which is a property of the machine, not of the policy. On a fast or
    idle host the merger keeps up, every card arrives at `eta == 0`, and Guarded
    correctly discards nothing. Observed failing on `main` in CI on Python 3.12
    (`proposals=26, sweeps=4, discarded_stale=0`) and, in a later run of the same
    commit, on 3.11 instead -- the version rotating between runs is the signature
    of a load-sensitive assertion rather than of a regression.

    What survives here is the part that *is* deterministic: Full discards nothing
    by definition, and Guarded can never discard less than Full. An inversion of
    those is a real bug and still fails.

    The strict claim -- that Guarded reaches DISCARD at all -- belongs to a test
    that can hold it, and two already do, both on seeded and bounded runs rather
    than on the clock:
    `test_staleness.py::test_a_refresh_interval_makes_every_staleness_action_reachable`
    asserts every branch including DISCARD is reachable, and
    `test_the_staleness_sweep_actually_varies_with_alpha` above asserts a tight
    alpha discards strictly more than a generous one.
