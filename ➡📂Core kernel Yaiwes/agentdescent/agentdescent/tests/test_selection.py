"""The candidate-selection seam, and the promise that adding it changed nothing.

The whole value of the default path is the *absence* of a behaviour change:
`SingleHead` has to be byte-for-byte what the engine already did, or every
measurement in the repository moved under a refactor. So the first test compares
a run with no policy against one that names the default, and the unit tests pin
the properties that make the other policies trustworthy without a ground truth
of their own -- chiefly that `Beam(1)` reaches `SingleHead`'s answer on the pool
`SingleHead` sees.

The second thing pinned here is the *refusal*. A policy chooses among the
candidates it is given; one that returns something else is refused rather than
committed, because a state no rollout produced has never been through the gate.
