"""Flags this runner accepts, and whether it reads them.

`--reflective-merge` sat in the shared parser for all eleven MethodPolicy ports
and was never read: `run_port` used `policy.reflective`, a per-method constant.
A run could pass the flag, print `reflective_merge=True` because the *policy*
said so, and be byte-identical to a run that did not pass it.

That is not only a dead flag. A control experiment in this series varied exactly
that flag, found the two arms identical, and concluded the merge layer was not
the cause of a failure -- a refutation built on a no-op.

Three more were found the same way -- `--async-ratio`, `--eval-concurrency` and
`--eval-cache`, declared by `add_standard_args` and never passed to `run_port`
-- plus `--val-cap`, which these ports cannot honour at all because their splits
are frozen in `build()`. `--async-ratio` is the one that cost a number: fifteen
rows in `bench/results/` recorded 2 and ran at `run_port`'s default of 1, and
nothing in the run's own output contradicted the number the author had asked
for -- see `tests/test_results_provenance.py`.

So this file no longer tests one flag. `test_every_declared_flag_is_honoured`
enumerates the parser and requires each flag to name where it is read, which
means the next flag added here cannot be decorative without a test failing.
