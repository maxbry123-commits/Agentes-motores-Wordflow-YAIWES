"""The control arms, and the guards that keep them a control.

These tests do not check that merging wins. Whether it does is an empirical
question and the answer is allowed to be no -- that is stated in the module
docstring and it is the reason the module exists. What is checked here is that
the comparison is *capable* of coming out either way: that the arms share one
workload, spend one budget, and report the spend they actually incurred.

The workload below is deliberately **not** the router domain. There each rule is
an independent row, so two workers' diffs cannot contradict and merging wins by
construction; a test that passed only there would be testing the domain. `Slot`
holds one answer at a time, so two workers proposing different rules genuinely
compete and a merge can be worse than either.
