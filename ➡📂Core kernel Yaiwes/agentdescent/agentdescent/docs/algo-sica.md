# SICA — Self-improving coding agent (real source edits)

> **Self-edit.** An archive of agent iterations; the best performer edits its own
> Python source and is re-benchmarked. Runs through the shared
> [`MethodPolicy`](policies.md) runner, behind an AST gate. Example:
> [`examples/sica/sica_self_edit.py`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/examples/sica/sica_self_edit.py).

| **Domain** | **GSM-Hard** ([`reasoning-machines/gsm-hard`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/reasoning-machines/gsm-hard)), 64/64/64 shuffled splits; one AST-gated policy function |

| **Fidelity** | `self_edit_analogue` — [what the classes mean](port-fidelity.md) |

This port is measured in the [runtime matrix](matrix-overview.md): the mechanism
is preserved and measured under AgentDescent's runtimes; it is **not** a
paper-benchmark reproduction.

## The mechanism

SICA keeps an **archive of agent iterations**; each meta-iteration selects the
best performer to act as improver and base — at the pinned revision, by best
mean score with a confidence-interval recency tiebreak (the paper's
0.5/0.25/0.25 score/cost/time composite utility is not implemented upstream
either). The selected agent then edits its own source and is re-benchmarked.

## Where each piece lives

| Upstream mechanism | Where it lives here |
|---|---|
| Real self-edits | proposals are complete Python sources through an AST gate (function surface, arity, node whitelist, no builtins) |
| Utility gate | the framework's held-out acceptance gate |
| Archive base selection | `Archive('best')` — a deterministic argmax over the archive, as upstream's `idxmax()` is — driven by the population aggregator; the run finalises on the archive's best scorer |

## Boundaries

- The editable surface is one AST-gated function rather than SWE-bench Docker.
- Utility is the score alone, faithful to the pinned code rather than the paper's composite.

## Measured results — GSM-Hard

Three seeds, `async_pipeline`, 80 rollouts each, 8 workers, `--staleness full`,
reflective merge on (this method's own declaration), `deepseek-v4-flash` at
temperature 0.7, 64/64/64 shuffled splits. Recorded in
[`bench/results/sica-self-edit.json`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/bench/results/sica-self-edit.json).

| seed | test quality | validation | accepted | invalid | calls |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0.703 → **0.750** | 0.562 → 0.625 | 3/80 | 3 | 942 |
| 1 | 0.625 → **0.625** | 0.578 → 0.625 | 0/80 | 1 | 880 |
| 2 | 0.594 → **0.625** | 0.641 → 0.719 | 2/80 | 1 | 876 |

Mean gain **+0.026** on test and +0.063 on validation, no seed regressing.

This row used to run `reflective=False`, and that was the right call while it
held: `ReflectiveFusion` reached the ledger **without** passing `to_diff`, so a
model-synthesised merge of two Python sources would have bypassed the AST gate
that makes executing them safe, and contested edits to the single policy slot
had to be resolved by **ranking** — which costs evaluations. `ReflectiveFusion`
now takes the strategy's validator and a synthesis that fails it returns `None`,
the existing fall-back-to-ranking signal, so the gate holds either way and the
flag is on.

See the caveat on [PromptBreeder](algo-promptbreeder.md#measured-results-gsm8k): one
run per seed does not pin a number here either.

!!! note "Why the splits are shuffled, and why selection is `best`"
    **The splits are one deterministic shuffle**, not positional. GSM-Hard is
    derived from GSM8K in order and its tail is harder: taking train and held-out
    from the head and test from the tail put an **0.18 gap** between them on every
    seed before any candidate was proposed, so a method was tuned on one
    distribution and reported on another. `gsmhard_splits` draws all three from
    one shuffle; the residual gaps are −0.156 / +0.016 / +0.062, mixed sign.

    **`Archive('best')`, not `'performance'`.** `get_best_agent_iteration` takes
    `idxmax()` of the mean benchmark score and `runner.py` runs that agent's code
    — there is no sampling in it. A softmax over scores in `[0, 1]` leaves only
    `exp(1)/exp(0) = 2.7` between the best and worst entry, which over a
    four-candidate archive scoring 0.2 / 0.9 / 0.5 / 0.9 starts from the *worst*
    agent 8 times in 40. Ties go to the earlier entry, as `idxmax` does.

    **The editable surface is checked before a run, not after.**
    `test_the_gate_admits_a_prompt_that_can_clear_the_domain` compiles a policy
    that solves the domain and asserts the AST gate lets it through, so a 0.000
    here would be the algorithm's result and not the harness's —
    [Voyager](algo-voyager.md#measured-results-crafting-world) is what that
    failure looks like when nobody checks.

## Run it

```bash
python -m examples.sica.sica_self_edit --dry-run

# one seed of the three above
python -m examples.sica.sica_self_edit --yes --seed 0 \
    --provider openai --model deepseek-v4-flash \
    --async --async-ratio 1 --workers 8 --budget-rollouts 80 --staleness full \
    --temperature 0.7 --max-seconds 3600
```

`--async-ratio 1` is what this row ran at: the flag was dropped before it
reached the runtime, so the run took the runner's default whatever the
command line said. It is passed explicitly here because the value matters and
a default can move.

Flags: [the MethodPolicy command line](self-evolution-examples.md#the-methodpolicy-command-line).

Offline tests: `tests/test_sica_upstream.py`, `tests/test_candidate_methods.py`.
