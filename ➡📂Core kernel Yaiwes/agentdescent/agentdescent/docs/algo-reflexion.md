This port is measured in the [runtime matrix](matrix-overview.md): the mechanism
is preserved and measured under AgentDescent's runtimes; it is **not** a
paper-benchmark reproduction.

## The mechanism

After a failed attempt, Reflexion converts the trajectory and the external
evaluator's signal into a **verbal reflection**, appends it to an episodic
memory, and retries the same task with that memory in context. The memory is
append-only and bounded to the last Ω entries (Ω=1–3 in the paper;
`memory[-3:]` in the pinned alfworld runs).

## Where each piece lives

| Upstream mechanism | Where it lives here |
|---|---|
| Bounded append-only memory | `WindowedMemory`: commit-ordered content-addressed keys, rendered as the last 3 entries |
| Reflect on external feedback | the proposal call, fed the strict evaluator's feedback |
| Retry with memory | the engine's held-out rerun |
| Parallel reflections | appends never contradict, so they union-merge with no ranking evaluation |

## Boundaries

- Upstream retries the same failed instance; the held-out rerun is the analogue.
- The equal-budget design requests a reflection after every rollout, not only on failure.

## Measured results — GSM-Hard

Three seeds, `async_pipeline`, 80 rollouts each, 8 workers, `--staleness full`,
reflective merge on (this method's own declaration), `deepseek-v4-flash` at
temperature 0.7. Recorded in
[`bench/results/reflexion-gsmhard.json`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/bench/results/reflexion-gsmhard.json).

| seed | test quality | validation | accepted | invalid | calls |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0.656 → **0.688** | 0.406 → 0.469 | 1/80 | 2 | 445 |
| 1 | 0.562 → **0.547** | 0.484 → 0.531 | 1/80 | 4 | 434 |
| 2 | 0.531 → **0.562** | 0.547 → 0.609 | 1/80 | 4 | 515 |

**Validation rises on every seed (+0.047 to +0.063) and test barely moves
(+0.016 mean, one seed negative).** That gap is the port's actual finding, and
it is the honest answer to the question this port asks: a reflection written
from one failure does raise the score on the split the gate judges, and
transfers to unseen questions weakly at best. Reflexion's memory is per
*instance* upstream and its whole move is retrying **that** instance, so a
shared memory asked to generalise is a question the paper does not ask.
`--per-instance` runs the faithful variant and is expected to accept nothing.

!!! note "Why GSM-Hard, and what the `invalid` column counts"
    **A memory fed by failures needs a domain that produces them.** On GSM8K
    this port accepted **0 of 80 on all three seeds**
    ([the run](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/bench/results/reflexion-gsm8k.json)
    is kept): held-out sat at 0.75–0.80, four rollouts in five succeeded and
    wrote nothing, and the failures that did occur shared no cause. GSM-Hard is
    the same 1319 questions with large numbers substituted — held-out starts at
    0.41–0.55 and the failures concentrate on one cause, arithmetic done in the
    model's head, which is a failure mode a transferable rule can address.

    That GSM8K run is also where the study's **±0.09 noise floor** comes from:
    nothing committed, so each pair is two evaluations of one unchanged
    instruction, and they differ by +0.094, −0.062 and −0.078.

    `invalid` counts `WindowedMemory`'s `is_a_plan` validator rejecting an
    entry — six alphabetic words, a **shape** floor rather than a quality bar,
    because whether a plan is any good is the held-out gate's question. It exists
    because the reflection prompt ends in `New plan:` above a failed question, so
    a bare number is a live continuation, and a bounded memory would let one
    displace a real plan.

!!! warning "Its baseline is not comparable with the other ports'"
    `WindowedMemory.render` emits `MEMORY_HEADER` **even when the memory is
    empty**, so this port's seed artifact reads:

    > Solve the grade-school math word problem. Return only the final answer.
    > \# Plans from past attempts. You have attempted problems like this before
    > and failed; these plans say how to avoid failing the same way. Use them to
    > improve your strategy (most recent last).
    > (empty)

    Every other port starts from the first line alone, and that header is itself
    an instruction to be careful. Reflexion did not start where they started, so
    its *gain* is not theirs to compare against — only its final score is.

## Run it

```bash
python -m examples.reflexion.reflexion_episodic_memory --dry-run

# one seed of the three above
python -m examples.reflexion.reflexion_episodic_memory --yes --seed 0 \
    --provider openai --model deepseek-v4-flash \
    --async --async-ratio 1 --workers 8 --budget-rollouts 80 --staleness full \
    --temperature 0.7 --max-seconds 3600
```

`--async-ratio 1` is what this row ran at: the flag was dropped before it
reached the runtime, so the run took the runner's default whatever the
command line said. It is passed explicitly here because the value matters and
a default can move.

`--per-instance` runs the faithful variant. Flags:
[the MethodPolicy command line](self-evolution-examples.md#the-methodpolicy-command-line).
