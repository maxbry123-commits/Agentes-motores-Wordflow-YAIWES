# R-Zero — Challenger/Solver co-evolution

> **Co-evolution of two roles.** A Challenger writes questions at the Solver's
> frontier and a Solver trains on majority-vote pseudo-labels. Runs through the
> shared [`MethodPolicy`](policies.md) runner. Example:
> [`examples/r_zero/r_zero_challenger_solver.py`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/examples/r_zero/r_zero_challenger_solver.py).

| **Layer** | L1 (`blast_radius=0.6`, set by the shared runner) |
| **Fidelity** | `inference_analogue` — [what the classes mean](port-fidelity.md) |

This port is measured in the [runtime matrix](matrix-overview.md): the mechanism
is preserved and measured under AgentDescent's runtimes; it is **not** a
paper-benchmark reproduction.

## The mechanism

Two copies of one base model co-evolve in alternating phases: the
**Challenger** is rewarded for questions at the Solver's frontier —
`min(p̂, 1−p̂)`, maximal when the Solver agrees with itself half the time —
minus a BLEU-cluster repetition penalty; the **Solver** trains on majority-vote
pseudo-labels filtered to an informative difficulty band (30–80% at the pinned
revision; the paper says 25–75%). Both are trained with GRPO.

## Where each piece lives

| Upstream mechanism | Where it lives here |
|---|---|
| Separate role updates | two plain-text `FieldSlots` keys with separate update calls |
| Uncertainty reward min(p̂,1−p̂) | two solver samples per generated task give an agreement rate, surfaced in the Challenger update |
| GRPO's group-relative shape | `AdvantageAcceptance` shifts the acceptance prior by group advantage |
| Frontier targeting | `DifficultyWeighted` — its 4p(1−p) weight shares peak and zeros with min(p̂,1−p̂) exactly |

## Boundaries

- Verbal role memories replace two GRPO-trained checkpoints.
- No BLEU repetition penalty; evaluation carts are frozen per seed.

## Measured results — self-play carts

Three seeds, `async_pipeline`, 80 rollouts each, 8 workers, `--staleness full`,
reflective merge on (this method's own declaration), four solver samples per
generated question, `deepseek-v4-flash` at temperature 0.7. Recorded in
[`bench/results/r-zero-challenger-solver.json`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/bench/results/r-zero-challenger-solver.json).

| seed | test quality | validation | accepted | invalid | calls |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0.062 → **0.188** | 0.125 → 0.438 | 2/80 | 0 | 943 |
| 1 | 0.062 → **0.375** | 0.125 → 0.375 | 3/80 | 0 | 941 |
| 2 | 0.062 → **0.312** | 0.062 → 0.312 | 1/80 | 0 | 926 |

All three seeds moved; mean gain +0.230. As on
[Absolute Zero](algo-absolute-zero.md#measured-results-self-play-carts), read the *gain*: the
carts are generated, so the baseline is not 0.000 and the ceiling is not 1.000.

See the caveat on [PromptBreeder](algo-promptbreeder.md#measured-results-gsm8k): one
run per seed does not pin a number here either.

!!! note "`p̂` carries no ground truth, by construction"
    `question_evaluate/evaluate.py` computes `max_count / len(results)` over
    `--num_samples` (default **9**) solver samples: the share agreeing with the
    **majority answer**. R-Zero has no ground truth for a question its Challenger
    just wrote — that is the premise — and rewards questions the Solver is
    *self-inconsistent* on, so the grounded verifier's reward must stay out of
    this term.

    Four samples here, not two: two give `p̂` only 0.5 and 1.0, which is a coin
    flip rather than a frontier. Unparseable replies count as their own distinct
    answers rather than being dropped — a Solver that cannot state an answer is
    not one that agrees with itself, and dropping them makes an incoherent batch
    read as certain.

    `min(p̂, 1−p̂)` peaks at a half, which is what `DifficultyWeighted`'s
    `4p(1−p)` is attached here to match — and why it is *not* attached to
    [Absolute Zero](algo-absolute-zero.md), whose `1−r̄` is monotone.

## Run it

```bash
python -m examples.r_zero.r_zero_challenger_solver --dry-run

# one seed of the three above
python -m examples.r_zero.r_zero_challenger_solver --yes --seed 0 \
    --provider openai --model deepseek-v4-flash \
    --async --async-ratio 1 --workers 8 --budget-rollouts 80 --staleness full \
    --temperature 0.7 --max-seconds 3600
```

`--async-ratio 1` is what this row ran at: the flag was dropped before it
reached the runtime, so the run took the runner's default whatever the
command line said. It is passed explicitly here because the value matters and
a default can move.

Flags: [the MethodPolicy command line](self-evolution-examples.md#the-methodpolicy-command-line).

Offline tests: `tests/test_selfplay_upstream.py`,
`tests/test_candidate_methods.py`.
