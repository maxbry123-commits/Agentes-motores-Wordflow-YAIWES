     * Names of sensitive environment variables this extension needs, such as
     * `"GITHUB_TOKEN"`.
     *
     * The Copilot CLI strips sensitive variables from every extension process
     * before it starts, so an extension that needs one must ask for it by name.
     * The CLI prompts the user with the extension's name and the exact list of
     * variables requested. On approval the granted values are written into this
     * process's `process.env` before {@link joinSession} resolves, so they are
     * readable afterwards. On denial the join rejects and the extension does not
     * load, so its tools never reach the model.
     *
     * An approval is remembered against the exact set of names the user saw, so
     * asking for an additional variable later prompts again. Names that are unset
     * or that the CLI does not filter from extensions are not prompted for. An
     * empty list means the same as omitting the option: nothing is requested.
     *
     * Requires a Copilot CLI that supports extension environment access; older
     * CLIs ignore the request and grant nothing.
     *
     * @example
     * ```typescript
     * const session = await joinSession({
     *     requestedEnvironmentVariables: ["GITHUB_TOKEN"],
     * });
     * const token = process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN;
