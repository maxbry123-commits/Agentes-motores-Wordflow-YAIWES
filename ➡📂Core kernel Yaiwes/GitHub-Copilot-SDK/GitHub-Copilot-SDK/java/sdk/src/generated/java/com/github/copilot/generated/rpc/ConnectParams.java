When set, the runtime forwards every internal telemetry event it emits — across all sessions, plus sessionless events — to this connection over the `gitHubTelemetry.event` notification. Regular events are also written to the runtime's normal GitHub/CTS path (dual-write); host-only compatibility events are forward-only and intentionally skip that path. Intended for first-party hosts that re-emit the events into their own telemetry stores. Both unrestricted and restricted events are forwarded, each tagged with a `restricted` discriminator; a backstop drops restricted events when restricted telemetry is disabled — using the process-global gate for ordinary events and an explicit session-scoped decision for host-only events. */
