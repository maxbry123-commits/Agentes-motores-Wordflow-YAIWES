Because the fallback page is a fresh boundary snapshot rather than a continuation of the requested cursor, it may overlap events the consumer has already rendered — a backward fallback to the tail in particular can repeat the newest window. On 'expired', consumers should reset or rebase their local pagination state (or deduplicate by event id) before continuing from the returned cursor rather than blindly appending/prepending the fallback page. */
