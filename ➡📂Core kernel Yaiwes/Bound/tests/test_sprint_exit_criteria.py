"""Sprint 1 exit criteria verification (v0.8.0).

Verifies that:

1. **Exit 1** — A new visitor can explain BOUND's purpose after watching the
   demo once.  (Documentation check: the README must describe BOUND's purpose
   clearly.)

2. **Exit 2** — Every decision visible in the dashboard can be traced to stored
   lineage.  We create a run, store decisions via the service layer, start the
   dashboard HTTP server, query ``/api/run/{id}``, and verify the returned
   decisions match the stored ones.

3. **Exit 3** — The demo reproduces from a clean checkout without manual
   evidence injection.  We simulate the full demo scenario: create a run,
   evaluate an action, record the outcome, and verify the complete lineage
   without any external data.
