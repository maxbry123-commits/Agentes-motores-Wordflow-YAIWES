    Every field is either a concrete, comparable quantity or an explicit
    ``None`` when it cannot be measured, so a consumer never has to guess
    whether a zero means "nothing saved" or "unknown".

    The headline metric is :attr:`steps_saved`: the number of agent steps BOUND
    would have avoided by stopping at :attr:`bound_stop_step` instead of letting
    the agent run to :attr:`actual_stop_step`. The companion metric
    :attr:`post_solution_unnecessary_steps` is the same quantity framed from the
    agent's perspective: how many steps the *real* agent executed after it had
    already reached a state that satisfied the task's acceptance criteria.

    Attributes:
        task_id: Identifier of the replayed task (echoed from the trajectory).
        accepted: Whether BOUND ever produced ``ACCEPT`` during the replay.
        bound_stop_step: Index of the first step that produced ``ACCEPT``;
            ``None`` when BOUND never accepted.
        actual_stop_step: Index at which the real agent stopped (echoed from the
            trajectory); ``None`` when unknown.
        steps_saved: ``actual_stop_step - bound_stop_step`` when both are known
            and BOUND accepted; otherwise ``None``.
        tool_calls_saved: Tool calls the agent made after the BOUND stop step,
            when both stop steps are known; otherwise ``None``.
        tokens_saved: Tokens consumed after the BOUND stop step, when both stop
            steps are known and the signal was tracked; otherwise ``None``.
        runtime_saved: Wall-clock seconds spent after the BOUND stop step, when
            both stop steps are known and the signal was tracked; otherwise
            ``None``.
        post_solution_unnecessary_steps: Agent steps executed after the earliest
            state that already satisfied the acceptance criteria. ``0`` when no
            satisfying state was ever reached; ``None`` when a satisfying state
            was reached but the real stop step is unknown.
        tests_pass_at_bound_stop: Whether tests fully passed at the BOUND stop
            step; ``None`` when BOUND never accepted or the signal was absent.
        required_checks_pass_at_bound_stop: Whether all required checks passed at
            the BOUND stop step; ``None`` when BOUND never accepted or the signal
            was absent.
        regressions_after_accept: Number of replayed steps after the first
            ``ACCEPT`` whose decision was no longer ``ACCEPT`` — i.e. the agent
            kept working and the state degraded below the threshold. ``0`` when
