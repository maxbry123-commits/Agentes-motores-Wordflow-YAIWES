    This is deliberately distinct from the free-form :attr:`CheckEvidence.source`

    tool name). Provenance records *how much that source can be trusted* so a
    consumer can never mistake an agent self-report for an independently
    verified observation. The ordering below is not a strict total order, but it
    reflects the intent of the BOUND v0.7 honesty model: stronger provenance
    must never be silently fabricated from weaker provenance.

    Members:
        OBSERVED: Directly measured by an independent collector at execution
            time (e.g. a process exit code, a tool-call counter). The most
            trustworthy *direct* provenance.
        VERIFIED: Independently reproduced/checked by a BOUND-controlled
            collector against a raw artefact (e.g. re-running pytest, hashing a
            JUnit file). Stronger than OBSERVED for claims about reproducibility
            because BOUND — not the agent — performed the check.
        ATTESTED: Signed/attested by a trusted third party (e.g. a signed build
            provenance, a CI attestation). Trusted without BOUND re-running it.
        EVALUATED: Derived by the deterministic BOUND evaluator from other
            evidence (e.g. an acceptance ratio computed from observed checks).
            Honest but not independently measured.
        CLAIMED: Agent self-report only — the agent *says* it is so, with no
            independent confirmation. Agent self-report is always CLAIMED, never
            VERIFIED. The weakest *present* provenance.
        DEFAULTED: No evidence source existed at all, so BOUND substituted a
            policy-neutral value (e.g. influence ``I = 0.0``). DEFAULTED must
            never be presented as VERIFIED — it is an explicit admission of
            absence, not a measurement.
        MISSING: No evidence was collected for this signal at all. ``None`` on
            an :class:`EvidenceMetric` value means MISSING, never ``0``: absence
            is not silently coerced to a measured zero.

    A check is anything whose pass/fail state can be determined deterministically
