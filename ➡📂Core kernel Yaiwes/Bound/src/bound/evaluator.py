    An evaluator's sole job is to turn an :class:`Action` into the four BOUND

    apply any threshold, weight, or decision logic — those belong to the
    deterministic :class:`~bound.policy.BoundPolicy`. This separation keeps the
    BOUND core reproducible regardless of which evaluator backs it.

    Concrete implementations may be deterministic (e.g. :class:`StaticEvaluator`
    or a rule-based scorer) or probabilistic (e.g. an LLM-as-judge adapter,
    deferred to a later phase). Either way, once the :class:`EvaluationScores`
    are produced, every downstream calculation is fully deterministic.

    The :class:`StaticEvaluator` holds a fixed :class:`EvaluationScores`

    computation, no network access, and imports no LLM SDK. Its purpose is to
    let tests, examples, and the CLI drive the BOUND pipeline end-to-end with
    fully known, reproducible inputs.

    Example:
        >>> from bound.models import Action, EvaluationScores
        >>> from bound.evaluator import StaticEvaluator
        >>> action = Action(description="Book the direct flight",
