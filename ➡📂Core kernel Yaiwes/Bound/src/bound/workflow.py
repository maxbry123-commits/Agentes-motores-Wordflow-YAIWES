class CodingWorkflowEvaluator:
    """Deterministic evaluator mapping workflow signals to BOUND scores.

    Implements the :class:`~bound.evaluator.Evaluator` Protocol. It holds a
    :class:`~bound.models.CodingWorkflowSignals` instance (plus a
    :class:`~bound.models.WorkflowNormalization`) and, on each
    :meth:`evaluate` call, derives :class:`~bound.models.EvaluationScores` with
    fully documented rules.

    All mappings are **v0.2 reference heuristics** — not scientifically
    calibrated:

    * **Acceptance (A)** ``∈ [0, 1]``: ``(mean of the available completion
      signals) × (evidence_breadth = n_available / 4)``, where the four
      completion signals are ``test_pass_rate``, ``required_checks_passed``,
      ``lint_passed`` → ``1.0``/``0.0`` and ``type_check_passed`` →
      ``1.0``/``0.0``. Unavailable (``None``) signals are ignored by the mean
      but reduce the evidence-breadth floor, so thin evidence can no longer
      yield maximum confidence (blind-spot fix). Raises :class:`ValueError`
      when no acceptance evidence is available at all.
    * **Risk (R)** ``∈ [0, 1]``: the mean of the *available* risk indicators —
      any ``unexpected_files_changed > 0``, ``rollback_available is False``, a
      large change surface via ``files_changed`` (graded against
      :data:`_LARGE_CHANGE_SURFACE_FILES`), failed checks (``1.0 - A``,
      reusing the acceptance gap), and the test-mutation signals
      ``tests_removed > 0`` (full surprise indicator) and ``tests_modified > 0``
      (a milder graded indicator). Every constant is documented above.
    * **Cost (C)** ``∈ [0, 1]``: the mean of the *available* normalized terms
      (``retry_count``, ``tool_call_count``, ``token_usage``,
      ``execution_time_seconds``), each ``min(value / cap, 1.0)`` against the
      configured :class:`WorkflowNormalization` caps. No hidden constants.
    * **Influence (I)** ``∈ [-1, 1]``: for v0.2, ``0.0`` by default with an
      explicit explanation, or a value supplied externally at construction.
      Honesty is preferred over invented sophistication.

    Example:
        >>> from bound.models import Action, CodingWorkflowSignals
        >>> from bound.workflow import CodingWorkflowEvaluator
        >>> # Two of four completion gates -> evidence_breadth = 2/4 = 0.5.
        >>> signals = CodingWorkflowSignals(test_pass_rate=1.0, lint_passed=True)
        >>> evaluator = CodingWorkflowEvaluator(signals)
        >>> scores = evaluator.evaluate(Action(description="Ship", goal="Release"))
