def is_valid_phase_id(phase_id: str) -> bool:
    """Return ``True`` when ``phase_id`` matches the BOUND stable-ID convention.

    BOUND v0.6 recommends that every meaningful planned step carry a stable,
    human-readable identifier that is preserved unchanged across the whole
    execution lineage::

        PLAN.md -> StepContract(id=...) -> ExecutionEvidence -> report

    so a reader can follow a single phase from intent to outcome. The
    recommended convention is::

        PHASE-001            base phase
        PHASE-002            another base phase
        PHASE-002-A          nested sub-phase of PHASE-002
        PHASE-002-B          a second nested sub-phase
        PHASE-001-R1         first replan of PHASE-001 (history preserved)
        PHASE-001-R2         second replan of PHASE-001

    This helper validates that shape. It is a *pure, optional* utility: it
    performs no network access, calls no LLM, and — crucially — is **not** wired
    into :class:`StepContract` validation. The contract ``id`` field stays a
    free-form ``str`` so non-``PHASE`` identifiers (e.g. ``write-tests``) remain
    legal; this function only lets integrations and tests *opt in* to the
    documented convention. Replans must append ``-R<N>`` rather than replacing
    the id, so the root identity (and its history) is never lost.

    Args:
        phase_id: The candidate identifier to validate.

    Returns:
        ``True`` if ``phase_id`` matches the ``PHASE-NNN[-R<n>][-<letter>]``
        convention (suffixes in either order); ``False`` otherwise (including
        for empty or non-string input rendered as a string).

    Example:
        >>> is_valid_phase_id("PHASE-001")
        True
        >>> is_valid_phase_id("PHASE-002-A")
