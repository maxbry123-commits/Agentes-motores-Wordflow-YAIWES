"""D1: a vetoed candidate is a failing candidate.

The lens / structural / call-graph vetoes remove sandbox-passing candidates
from selection. Before the fix they left ``passed=True`` on the candidate
dict, so the phase-3 pool (``not c.get("passed")``) excluded them, selection
excluded them, and the final energy fallback could return the vetoed
candidate itself — the exact stub the veto existed to block.

These tests drive the full ``V3PipelineService.run`` orchestration with all
service adapters faked, reproduce the all-passing-candidates-vetoed scenario,
and assert:
  * vetoed candidates are marked (``passed=False`` + ``vetoed_by``) and enter
    phase-3 repair like any failing candidate (PR-CoT sees the veto reason);
  * the energy fallback never returns a vetoed candidate — a non-vetoed
    sandbox-failing candidate wins even at higher energy, and an all-vetoed
    set returns no code at all.
