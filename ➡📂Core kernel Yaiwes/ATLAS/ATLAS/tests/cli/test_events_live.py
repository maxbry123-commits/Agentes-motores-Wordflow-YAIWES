"""Live cross-language integration tests for the event protocol (PC-061).

These tests start a real atlas-proxy binary and exercise iter_events()
against /events via HTTP. They prove the full producer → SSE wire →
consumer pipeline works across the Go/Python boundary.

Skipped automatically when the proxy binary isn't available — keeps
the unit-test suite lean and the integration tests opt-in via a
pre-built binary.
