"""Unit tests for the harness-defect detectors in scripts/e2e-reliability.py.

The detectors decide whether a live session's failure was ATLAS's fault or the
model's, so a detector that silently stops firing turns the reliability number
into a rubber stamp. Each test below is a synthetic event stream reproducing a
defect that was actually observed on 2026-07-31, plus the corresponding clean
stream, so a detector cannot pass by flagging everything.

No live stack: streams are literals and the workspace is a tmp_path.
