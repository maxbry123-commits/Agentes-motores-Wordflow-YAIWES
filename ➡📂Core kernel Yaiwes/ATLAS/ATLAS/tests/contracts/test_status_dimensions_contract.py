"""Status-dimension parity contract.

The canonical seven-dimension lens/ASA status is defined once in the Go
producer (proxy/calibration_status.go, buildDimensions) and rendered by
the TUI badge, atlas doctor, and documented in SUPPORT_MATRIX. This
contract asserts the dimension NAMES agree across those surfaces so a
rename in one place can't silently desync the others.

Parsing only — no services are started.
