"""The TUI actually runs, paints, and consumes the proxy's event stream.

`tests/contracts/test_event_contract.py` proves the proxy and the TUI agree on
event NAMES by reading both sources. It cannot prove the binary starts, paints a
frame, or survives the events it is sent — and a Bubble Tea program refuses to
run at all without a terminal, so a subprocess pipe would only ever prove that
it exits.

This allocates a pty, runs the real binary against the running proxy, and reads
the painted frames back. Live-stack test: deselected by the default
`-m 'not integration'`, run it with `-m integration` on a host with the stack up
and `tui/atlas-tui` built.
