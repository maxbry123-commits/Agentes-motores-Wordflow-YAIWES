"""Measured reliability of the live stack: proxy + v3-service + lens + sandbox.

`tests/e2e/` drives fake llama/lens/v3 handlers, which is what makes it
deterministic enough for CI — and also what stops it from telling you whether
the real services work together. This runs real sessions against the running
stack and reports two numbers that must not be conflated:

  Harness Integrity Rate  sessions in which ATLAS's own plumbing did nothing
                          wrong. Independent of whether the model succeeded at
                          the task, and the number that should be 100%.

  Task Success Rate       sessions where the requested change actually landed.
                          Bounded by the model's coding ability, so a low value
                          is evidence about the model, not about ATLAS.

The split matters because "it built a snake game" moves with model skill and
sampling luck, so it cannot tell you whether a pipeline regression shipped. A
harness defect is instead something provable from the event stream and the
workspace: a rejection whose stated reason does not hold against the file on
disk, steering that names a remedy the target cannot accept, an exit that
escaped the gates, a corrupt write, a service fault, an orphaned tool call, an
event the TUI cannot render, or a background job left running after the session.

Usage:
    python scripts/e2e-reliability.py                 # default suite, 2 reps
    python scripts/e2e-reliability.py --reps 5
    python scripts/e2e-reliability.py --tasks flask_pause,add_function
    python scripts/e2e-reliability.py --json out.json

Requires the stack to be up (docker compose ps) and ATLAS_PROJECT_DIR to be the
workspace the proxy has mounted at /workspace.
