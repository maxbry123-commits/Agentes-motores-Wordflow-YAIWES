# Contributing to ATLAS

Guidelines for contributing to ATLAS.

- [DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) — dev iteration workflow (rebuilds, host-side proxy, tests)
- [PUBLISHING.md](docs/PUBLISHING.md) — publishing Lens / ASA artifacts
- [RELEASE.md](docs/RELEASE.md) — release contract and verification levels
- [STORY.md](docs/STORY.md) — project background

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

Before opening an issue:

1. Search existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. Check the [troubleshooting guide](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
3. Gather relevant information:
   - ATLAS version/commit hash
   - Operating system and version
   - GPU model and driver version
   - Output of `docker compose ps` (or `kubectl get pods` on K3s)
   - Relevant logs

When opening an issue:

1. Use a clear, descriptive title
2. Describe the expected vs actual behavior
3. Provide steps to reproduce
4. Include logs and configuration (remove secrets)

### Suggesting Features

Feature requests are welcome. Please:

1. Describe the use case and problem you're solving
2. Explain how your feature would work
3. Consider implementation complexity and trade-offs

### Pull Requests

#### Before You Start

1. Check existing issues/PRs for similar changes
2. For major changes, open an issue first to discuss
3. Fork the repository and create a feature branch

#### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/atlas.git
cd atlas

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Copy configuration
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env if you need to change model path or ports

# Run the complete developer quality gate before making changes
python scripts/production-readiness.py
```

#### Making Changes

1. Follow existing code style and patterns
2. Write tests for new functionality
3. Update documentation as needed
4. Keep commits focused and atomic
5. Write clear commit messages

#### Commit Message Format

```
component: short description (50 chars max)

Longer description if needed. Explain what and why,
not how (the code shows how).

Fixes #123
```

Examples:
- `geometric-lens: add project caching for faster queries`
- `sandbox: increase default timeout to 90s`
- `docs: add GPU troubleshooting section`

#### Submitting

1. Ensure all required checks pass: `python scripts/production-readiness.py`
2. Update CHANGELOG.md if applicable
3. Push to your fork
4. Open a pull request with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Link to related issues
   - Test results

#### Code Review

- Address review feedback promptly
- Explain your decisions when disagreeing
- Request re-review after making changes

### Contributing Trained Artifacts (Lens / ASA)

Code isn't the only thing you can contribute. ATLAS ships per-model
**Geometric Lens** cost fields (`cost_field.pt`) and **ASA control
vectors** (`*.gguf`) — these are coupled to the base model they were
trained against, so every new model needs its own pair before ATLAS
runs end-to-end against it. If you've trained one, please contribute
it back.

You train locally with `atlas lens build` / `atlas asa build`, then run
`atlas lens publish` / `atlas asa publish` to upload to a HuggingFace repo
you own and open a registry PR. You do NOT need a GitHub PAT or write
access to this repo — a HuggingFace account and write token is enough. The
full walkthrough (credential setup, verification, troubleshooting) is in
**[docs/PUBLISHING.md](docs/PUBLISHING.md)**; CLI flag reference is in
[docs/CLI.md](docs/CLI.md).

## Code Style

### Python

- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints for function signatures
- Document public functions with docstrings
- Maximum line length: 100 characters

```python
def process_chunk(
    content: str,
    file_path: str,
    start_line: int,
) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Process a code chunk for vector storage.

    Args:
        content: The chunk text content
        file_path: Source file path
        start_line: Starting line number

    Returns:
        Dictionary with chunk metadata and embedding
    """
    ...
```

### Bash

- Use shellcheck for linting
- Quote variables: `"$var"` not `$var`
- Use `[[` for conditionals
- Add comments for non-obvious logic

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

# Check if model file exists
if [[ ! -f "$MODEL_PATH" ]]; then
    echo "Error: Model not found at $MODEL_PATH" >&2
    exit 1
fi
```

### YAML/Kubernetes

- Use 2-space indentation
- Add resource limits to all containers
- Use meaningful names and labels

### Documentation

- Use Markdown for all documentation
- Include code examples where helpful
- Keep language clear and concise
- Update table of contents when adding sections

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run the developer quality gate. Its python test gates cover the same
# suites CI runs: python-tests runs tests/v3, tests/v3-service, tests/cli,
# tests/infrastructure, tests/concurrency, tests/perf, tests/contracts,
# and tests/e2e; python-tests-lens runs geometric-lens/tests in its own
# process (as CI does). tests/e2e skips cleanly without the built proxy
# binary; the lens gate needs the lens requirements (CPU torch is enough).
python scripts/production-readiness.py

# Run only the test-integrity validator
python scripts/production-readiness.py --only test-integrity

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/v3/test_plan_search.py -v

# Run with coverage (needs `pip install pytest-cov` — not a declared dependency)
pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=html

# End-to-end acceptance test (real proxy + sandbox executor + fake
# llama-server; no GPU or model needed). Build the proxy binary first.
cd proxy && go build -o /tmp/test-atlas-proxy . && cd ..
pip install -r sandbox/requirements-runtime.txt
pytest tests/e2e -v
```

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in `tests/` directory
- Name test files `test_*.py`
- Use descriptive test function names
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Keep tests hermetic: never depend on a repo-root `.env`. CI runs on a
  clean checkout with no `.env`, so a test that reads it (directly, or by
  shelling out to a script that does) passes locally and fails in CI. Create
  your own `tmp_path / ".env"` or pass values via the subprocess environment.
  The `tests/cli/` suite moves any local `.env` aside so local runs match CI;
  to mimic that elsewhere, run with `.env` temporarily renamed.

```python
def test_chunk_overlap_preserves_context():
    """Verify chunk overlap includes surrounding lines."""
    chunks = chunk_file(content, chunk_size=100, overlap=20)

    # Verify overlap exists
    assert chunks[0].end_line >= chunks[1].start_line
```

### Test Requirements

- New features must include tests
- Bug fixes should include regression tests
- Maintain or improve test coverage

## Architecture Decisions

When proposing architectural changes:

1. Document the problem and proposed solution
2. List alternatives considered
3. Explain trade-offs
4. Consider backwards compatibility
5. Update architecture documentation

## Release Process

Releases are handled by maintainers:

1. Update version in relevant files
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Create git tag
4. Build and push container images
5. Create GitHub release
