"""Graph-backed call resolution for the structural veto (issue #39, Phase 1).

The shipped veto (v3-service `structural_score`) accepts a bare call name if ANY
project file defines a top-level symbol with that name, even when the candidate
never imports it. That lets through genuine broken cross-file references (a
NameError the sandbox can miss on an unexecuted path). This module resolves
direct-identifier calls precisely against the import graph instead:

- a call resolves if its name is defined locally, is a builtin, is an imported
  name, or is supplied by a wildcard import whose module's *actual* exports
  include it (resolved via the call graph, not blanket-accepted);
- when a wildcard import can't be resolved to an in-batch file (stdlib /
  third-party), resolution is treated as uncertain and nothing is flagged
  (conservative, matching today's leniency);
- attribute / method calls (`obj.foo()`) are out of scope, exactly as the
  shipped veto, because the receiver type isn't statically known.

`strict=False` restores the old behavior (accept any project symbol) so the veto
can be tightened gradually.
