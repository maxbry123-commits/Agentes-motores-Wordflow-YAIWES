    the agent doesn't have to reason about whether to stop.

    In workflow mode, ``AbortAll`` also deactivates the active workflow
    (a workflow is one unit of work — there is no point in keeping it
    active with no tasks left), so the agent returns to catalog mode and
    can activate another workflow or chat freely.

    Attached to a :class:`Task` via ``Task(summarize=...)``.  When the task
    transitions to ``complete``, the middleware replaces task messages
    according to the chosen mode.

    Modes:

    ``"replace"``
        Removes **all** messages produced during the task and inserts a
        single ``AIMessage`` whose content is *content*.  Use this when
        you already know the summary (e.g. a static acknowledgment).

    ``"summarize"``
        Feeds the task messages to an LLM and replaces every
        ``AIMessage`` / ``ToolMessage`` produced during the task with the
        LLM's summary (``HumanMessage`` objects are preserved).  The LLM
        receives the task instruction in its system prompt for context.

    Args:
        mode: ``"replace"`` or ``"summarize"``.
        content: Replacement text for ``"replace"`` mode (required).
        model: Chat model for ``"summarize"`` mode.  Any LangChain
            ``BaseChatModel``.  Optional — if ``None``, falls back to
            ``TaskSteeringMiddleware(model=...)`` (the same model used
            by ``create_agent`` / ``create_deep_agent``).
        prompt: Custom ``HumanMessage`` content appended after the task
            messages when calling the summarization model.  Use this to
            give explicit instructions on *how* to summarize (e.g.
            ``"List every tool call and its result."``).  If ``None``, a
            default instruction is used.
        trim_complete_message: If ``True`` (default), strip the text
            content from the complete-transition ``AIMessage``, keeping
            only its ``tool_calls``.  The text is redundant once the
            summary is in the ``ToolMessage``.
