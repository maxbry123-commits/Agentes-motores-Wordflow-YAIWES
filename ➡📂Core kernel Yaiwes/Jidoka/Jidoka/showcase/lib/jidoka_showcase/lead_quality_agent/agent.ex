  @guide """
  This example demonstrates a multi-tool decision path with structured output.

  Ask whether a lead is worth pursuing. The agent should enrich the lead first,
  score the enriched profile second, then return a structured qualification
  summary that the UI can render without scraping text.

  This is still a thin Jidoka loop: the domain-specific behavior lives in Jido
  actions, while controls bound the run and the result schema validates the
  final answer shape.
