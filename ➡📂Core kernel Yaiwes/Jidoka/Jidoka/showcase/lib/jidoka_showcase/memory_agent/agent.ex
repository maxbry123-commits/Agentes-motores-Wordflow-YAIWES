  This example shows durable session memory through Jidoka's memory contract
  backed by `jido_memory`.

  First tell the agent a preference to remember. The agent should call
  remember_preference. Then ask a follow-up question in the same session; Jidoka
  recalls memory before prompt assembly and injects it into the model context.

  The point is not a custom app-level session store. The memory path is a
  Jidoka feature, with `jido_memory` providing the Jido ecosystem backend.
