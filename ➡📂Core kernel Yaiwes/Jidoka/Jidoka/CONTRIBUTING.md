# Contributing To Jidoka

Jidoka follows the Jido ecosystem package quality standards:

- keep library code in `lib/`;
- keep example-only app wiring in `showcase/`;
- keep public documentation and standalone Livebooks in `guides/`;
- keep complete reference agents in `examples/`;
- keep local planning and research notes in the ignored `docs/` directory;
- validate public data with Zoi structs;
- normalize package errors through `Jidoka.Error`;
- keep the Runic turn spine deterministic and runtime effects explicit.

## Setup

```bash
mix deps.get
```

## Quality Gate

Run the package gate before opening a PR:

```bash
mix quality
mix test --cover
mix hex.build --unpack
```

### ReqLLM Compatibility

Jidoka supports ReqLLM `~> 1.20.0` and tests the exact version in `mix.lock`.
Do not widen this range as part of an unrelated dependency update.

To update ReqLLM, change and test Jidoka first. Run the ReqLLM adapter tests and
the full quality gate. Then update the Jido CLI lock and run its dependency
contract with both the pinned Jidoka dependency and `JIDO_CLI_JIDOKA_PATH`.
A new ReqLLM minor line requires an explicit constraint change in both
repositories. A patch release in the current line requires fresh locks and the
same cross-repository tests.

Live provider tests are opt-in and require provider keys in the process
environment. Jidoka does not implement dotenv loading. ReqLLM loads `.env` by
default, but this source checkout disables that behavior for deterministic
tests. Use your shell or host app config to provide credentials:

```bash
mix test --include live test/jidoka/live_req_llm_test.exs
```

## Release Notes

Use conventional commits for changes. The release workflow generates release
notes from Git history. Do not edit `CHANGELOG.md` by hand. Publish through the
version-controlled GitHub release workflow, not through an ad hoc local Hex
publish.

## Jidoka-Specific Exceptions

Jidoka intentionally keeps the public package root as `Jidoka`, not
`Jido.Jidoka`, because this package is an application layer built on the Jido
ecosystem rather than a Jido core subpackage.

The Phoenix companion app lives in `showcase/`. This name separates UI and
system integration from package-level examples in `examples/`. Showcase-only
dependencies stay isolated and do not enter the primary package runtime graph.
