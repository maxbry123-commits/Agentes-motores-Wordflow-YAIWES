# Streaming

Every turn can publish events as it runs. Use streaming when a UI needs partial
assistant text, progress events, or a live activity feed.

## Use This When

- a UI needs to render partial assistant text as it is
  produced (chat UIs, CLIs, agent dashboards).
- an operator console wants live progress events.
- do not use streaming as durable telemetry. Live events are best-effort
  and per-request. For post-hoc inspection use
  [Tracing And Events](tracing-and-events.md).

## Prerequisites

- A turn or session you can run with a live provider.
- A consumer process (the caller itself, a `GenServer`, or a LiveView)
  ready to receive mailbox messages.

```bash
mix deps.get
mix test
```

## Stream A Chat

For UI work, start the chat asynchronously and request streaming events.

```elixir
{:ok, request} =
  Jidoka.chat_async(MyApp.SupportAgent, "Hi", stream: true)

stream = Jidoka.stream(request)

for event <- stream do
  if text = Jidoka.Stream.text_delta(event) do
    IO.write(text)
  end
end

{:ok, text} = Jidoka.await(request)
```

The stream yields `Jidoka.Event` values and stops when the turn finishes,
fails, or hibernates.

Cancel an active request through its handle:

```elixir
{:ok, %Jidoka.Cancellation{} = cancellation} =
  Jidoka.cancel(request, grace_ms: 100)

{:cancelled, ^cancellation} = Jidoka.await(request)
```

Cancellation first asks the runtime and active capabilities to stop. If they
do not stop within `:grace_ms`, Jidoka stops the request process tree. The
stream receives one terminal `:turn_failed` event with
`data.reason == :cancelled`. It cannot later receive `:turn_finished`.

## Concepts

Streaming is a per-request side channel. The runtime stays terminal-result
oriented.

```

Key facts:

- [`Jidoka.Stream.message_tag/0`](`Jidoka.Stream.message_tag/0`) returns
  `:jidoka_turn_event`. Every mailbox-routed event is the 2-tuple
  `{tag, %Jidoka.Event{}}`.
- [`Jidoka.Stream.terminal?/1`](`Jidoka.Stream.terminal?/1`) returns
  `true` for `:turn_finished`, `:turn_failed`, and `:turn_hibernated`.
  These are the only events that end the stream.
- `:stream_to` may be a pid or `{:pid, pid}`. `:on_event` is a 1-arity
  function called inline; failures are silently ignored so a buggy
  callback never poisons the turn.
- `Jidoka.Stream.text_delta/1` extracts content text from `:llm_delta`
  events. `Jidoka.Stream.thinking_delta/1` does the same for reasoning
  channels.
- `Jidoka.Stream.events/2` builds a mailbox-backed `Stream` enumerable
  scoped to a `request_id`. Use it when you want a lazy enumerable rather
  than a hand-rolled `receive`.
- `Jidoka.cancel/2` returns typed `Jidoka.Cancellation` evidence after
  bounded cleanup. Capabilities can call
  `Jidoka.Cancellation.requested?/1` with their runtime context when they
  support their own cooperative cleanup.
- The request controller keeps a terminal result for 30 seconds so a caller
  can await it again. It then stops. `:request_retention_ms` can set a
  smaller positive bound. After expiry, await and cancel return
  `:request_expired` and do not restart work. Owner exit, timeout, error,
  and cancellation stop the controller and its registered members. A
  cleanup race cannot create a second terminal event or a second live
  controller.

## How To

### Step 1: Stream To A Pid

Pass the consumer process as `:stream_to`. The caller is the simplest
consumer.

```elixir
{:ok, _result} =
  Jidoka.turn(MyApp.SupportAgent, "Hello",
    stream_to: self()
  )
```

Inside a `GenServer`, set `stream_to: self()` from the handler that
issued the turn; the events arrive in `handle_info/2`.

### Step 2: Use The Receive Loop

The terminal-event contract makes the loop trivial.

```elixir
def collect_events(request_id) do
  tag = Jidoka.Stream.message_tag()

  Stream.repeatedly(fn ->
    receive do
      {^tag, %Jidoka.Event{request_id: ^request_id} = event} -> event
    after
      5_000 -> :timeout
    end
  end)
  |> Enum.reduce_while([], fn
    :timeout, acc -> {:halt, Enum.reverse(acc)}
    event, acc -> if Jidoka.Stream.terminal?(event), do: {:halt, Enum.reverse([event | acc])}, else: {:cont, [event | acc]}
  end)
end
```

Always filter on `request_id`. The mailbox tag is shared across turns,
and a parallel turn from the same caller will interleave events.

### Step 3: Render Token Deltas

For chat UIs, the interesting event is `:llm_delta`. Use
`Jidoka.Stream.text_delta/1` to grab the content text.

```elixir
def handle_info({:jidoka_turn_event, %Jidoka.Event{} = event}, state) do
  case Jidoka.Stream.text_delta(event) do
    text when is_binary(text) ->
      {:noreply, append_delta(state, text)}

    nil ->
      {:noreply, state}
  end
end
```

`Jidoka.Stream.thinking_delta/1` is the matching helper for reasoning
channels. Capabilities that emit `:llm_delta` directly should call
`Jidoka.Stream.emit/2` from inside the LLM function.

### Step 4: Use An `on_event` Callback

`:on_event` is a 1-arity function. It runs inline before the next event
is emitted; raised or thrown values are swallowed so the turn keeps
running.

```elixir
{:ok, _result} =
  Jidoka.turn(MyApp.SupportAgent, "Hello",
    on_event: fn event ->
      :telemetry.execute(
        [:my_app, :agent, :event],
        %{seq: event.seq},
        %{event: event.event, agent_id: event.agent_id}
      )
    end
  )
```

`:stream_to` and `:on_event` can be used together. The callback fires
first; the mailbox delivery happens immediately after.

### Step 5: Build A Lazy Enumerable

For consumers that prefer `Enum.reduce/3`, the
`Jidoka.Stream.events/2` helper wraps the receive loop.

```elixir
Task.async(fn ->
  Jidoka.turn(MyApp.SupportAgent, "Hello",
    request_id: "req_demo",
    stream_to: self()
  )
end)

events =
  "req_demo"
  |> Jidoka.Stream.events(stream_event_timeout_ms: 5_000)
  |> Enum.to_list()

Enum.map(events, & &1.event)
```

The enumerable halts when it sees a terminal event for the request or
when the per-event timeout fires.

### Step 6: Stream Through A Session

Sessions accept the same options.

```elixir
{:ok, _session, _text} =
  Jidoka.Session.chat(session_id, "Hi",
    store: store,
    stream_to: self(),
    on_event: &MyApp.Audit.publish/1
  )
```

The terminal events still apply: `:turn_hibernated` ends the stream for
that turn even though the session may continue later.

### Step 7: Cancel A Session Request

Start the session turn asynchronously, then cancel the returned handle.

```elixir
{:ok, request} =
  Jidoka.Session.chat_async(session_id, "Prepare report",
    store: store,
    stream: true
  )

{:ok, cancellation} = Jidoka.Session.cancel(request)
{:cancelled, ^cancellation} = Jidoka.Session.await(request)
```

A persisted active session changes to `:cancelled`. The session stores the
typed cancellation value in its `error` field. Cancellation does not roll
back an external operation that already completed. Operations must use their
idempotency keys and reconciliation policy for that case.

## Common Patterns

- **Always filter on `request_id`.** Concurrent turns share the mailbox
  tag. Filtering keeps consumers correct under load.
- **Render deltas, log lifecycle.** UIs typically only care about
  `:llm_delta`; observability layers care about `:turn_started`,
  `:turn_finished`, `:turn_failed`.
- **Treat `:turn_hibernated` as a stream terminator.** It is not an
  error; it is a normal pause. Resume separately.
- **Use `on_event:` for in-process side effects.** Mailbox delivery is
  best for cross-process consumers; inline callbacks are best for
  telemetry inside the same process.
- **Do not lean on streaming for state.** Use `Turn.Result` for the final
  truth; use streaming for UX.
- **Treat cancellation as a terminal result.** Match on
  `{:cancelled, %Jidoka.Cancellation{}}`. Do not convert it to success.
- **Keep the prefix for a cancelled sequence.** An asynchronous session
  sequence returns `{:cancelled, cancellation, sequence}`. The sequence has all
  completed steps and typed terminal evidence.

## Testing

The runtime's own tests use `assert_receive` against the mailbox tag.

```elixir
test "stream_to publishes lifecycle events" do
  llm = fn _intent, _journal, _ctx ->
    {:ok, %{type: :final, content: "stream ok"}}
  end

  request = Jidoka.Turn.Request.new!(input: "Hello", request_id: "req_x")

  assert {:ok, %Jidoka.Turn.Result{content: "stream ok"}} =
           Jidoka.turn(MyApp.SupportAgent, request, llm: llm, stream_to: self())

  tag = Jidoka.Stream.message_tag()
  assert_receive {^tag, %Jidoka.Event{event: :turn_started, request_id: "req_x"}}
  assert_receive {^tag, %Jidoka.Event{event: :prompt_assembled, request_id: "req_x"}}
  assert_receive {^tag, %Jidoka.Event{event: :turn_finished, request_id: "req_x"} = terminal}

  assert Jidoka.Stream.terminal?(terminal)
end
```

For UI tests, prefer the `events/2` enumerable so the test runs
deterministically without polling.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mailbox receives no events | `:stream_to` was not passed to the turn. | Pass `stream_to: pid` (or `{:pid, pid}`) on the call. |
| Wrong events arrive | Concurrent turns share the mailbox tag. | Match on `request_id` in the receive clause. |
| `:llm_delta` events missing | Capability did not call `Jidoka.Stream.emit/2`. | Emit `:llm_delta` from the LLM function or use a streaming provider. |
| `on_event:` callback errors disappear | Jidoka ignores callback failures so the turn can finish. | Log inside the callback before raising. |
| Loop never terminates | Consumer never saw a terminal event. | Always check `Jidoka.Stream.terminal?/1` and add an `after` timeout. |
| `Jidoka.Stream.events/2` halts immediately | Default `:stream_event_timeout_ms` elapsed before the turn ran. | Increase the timeout, or start the turn before subscribing. |
| Cancel returns `:request_already_finished` | A terminal event won the race before cancellation. | Use the completed result. Jidoka never replaces it with cancellation. |
