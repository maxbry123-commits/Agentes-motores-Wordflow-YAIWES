# Inspection And Preflight

Use `Jidoka.inspect/2`, `Jidoka.preflight/3`, and `Jidoka.project/1` before
spending tokens. They show what the agent compiled to, what prompt would be
sent, and what data shape your UI or tests can consume.

## Use This When

- an agent looks correct but behaves unexpectedly at runtime;
- comparing a DSL-authored spec with an imported one;
- writing golden tests against compact, deterministic
  projections.

## Prerequisites

- A working Jidoka agent module (see [Getting Started](getting-started.md)).
- Familiarity with the operation contract from
  [Tools And Operations](tools-and-operations.md).
- No provider keys are required; these calls do not contact an LLM.

```bash
mix deps.get
mix test
```

## Preflight A Turn

Start with `preflight/3` to assemble the exact prompt and operation list for the
next turn. Use `inspect/2` when you also need the compiled spec and plan.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.TimeAgent do
  use Jidoka.Agent

  agent :time_agent do
    model "openai:gpt-4o-mini"
    instructions "Call local_time when asked for the time."
  end

  tools do
    action MyApp.Tools.LocalTime
  end
end

{:ok, preflight} = Jidoka.preflight(MyApp.TimeAgent, "What time is it?")
preflight.prompt.messages
preflight.prompt.operations
preflight.diagnostics

Jidoka.inspect(MyApp.TimeAgent)
#=> %{kind: :agent, module: "MyApp.TimeAgent",
#=>   spec: %{id: "time_agent", operations: [%{name: "local_time", ...}], ...},
#=>   plan: %{...}}
```

Nothing was sent over the network. The view shows what Jidoka would send if
the turn ran for real.

## Concepts

The three functions cover three layers of the data-first runtime.

1. **`Jidoka.preflight/3`** takes a request and stops before the LLM or any
   operation runs. The returned `Jidoka.Inspection.Preflight` struct shows the
   normalized agent, plan, request, prompt, events, timeline, and diagnostics.
2. **`Jidoka.inspect/2`** is the human-facing wrapper. It dispatches on the
   value's struct and returns a tagged map with a `:kind` key plus the
   most useful fields for that kind. Internally it calls `project/1` and
   often adds a timeline view, a status badge, or related context.
3. **`Jidoka.project/1`** is the low-level projector. It turns Jidoka data
   contracts (`Agent.Spec`, `Turn.Plan`, `Turn.Result`, `Effect.Journal`,
   etc.) into JSON-friendly maps. Use it when you need compact data for tests,
   traces, or external rendering.

### Picking The Right Function

| Question | Tool | Effect-free? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "What did the DSL/import compile to?" | `Jidoka.inspect(agent_or_spec)` | yes |
| "What workflow graph did this module compile to?" | `Jidoka.inspect(workflow_module)` | yes |
| "How does this turn input shape the prompt?" | `Jidoka.preflight(agent, input)` | yes |
| "What is the deterministic projection of this value?" | `Jidoka.project(value)` | yes |
| "What happened during the turn that just ran?" | `Jidoka.inspect(turn_result)` | yes |
| "Debug the exact request that just ran." | `Jidoka.Debug.request(turn_result)` | yes |
| "Replay this snapshot." | `Jidoka.resume(snapshot, opts)` | no, runs effects |

## How To

### Step 1: Inspect An Agent Module Or Spec

`Jidoka.inspect/2` accepts a DSL agent module, an `Agent.Spec`, a
`Turn.Plan`, or any other Jidoka value. For modules and specs it returns a
combined view with the compiled plan attached.

```elixir
view = Jidoka.inspect(MyApp.TimeAgent)
view.kind
#=> :agent

view.module
#=> "MyApp.TimeAgent"

view.spec.id
#=> "time_agent"

view.spec.operations
#=> [%{name: "local_time", idempotency: :idempotent, metadata: %{...}}]

view.plan.prompt_strategy
#=> :default
```

For raw structs (Effect intents, results, sessions, eval runs) inspect
dispatches on the struct and returns the matching tagged view.

### Step 2: Inspect A Workflow Module

`Jidoka.inspect/1` also accepts `Jidoka.Workflow` modules. Use this before
exposing a workflow as an agent tool.

```elixir
view = Jidoka.inspect(MyApp.Workflows.RefundReview)

view.kind
#=> :workflow

view.workflow.id
#=> "refund_review"

Enum.map(view.workflow.steps, &{&1.name, &1.kind})
#=> [check_policy: :function, queue_refund: :action]

view.workflow.parameters_schema?
#=> true
```

When the same workflow is registered in an agent, inspect the agent operation
metadata to confirm the model-visible name, result mode, timeout, and
parameters schema:

```elixir
Jidoka.inspect(MyApp.SupportAgent).spec.operations
|> Enum.find(&(&1.metadata.source == "workflow"))
|> Map.take([:name, :idempotency, :metadata])
```

### Step 3: Preflight A Turn

`Jidoka.preflight/3` validates the context and uses the same pure turn builder
as execution. It does not call an operation source, instruction provider, or
memory store. Pass effectful data after you resolve it:

- `resolved_operations:` for operations from an external source;
- `resolved_instructions:` for output from an instruction provider;
- `resolved_memory:` for a memory recall result.

If configured data is not resolved, preflight returns an
`unresolved_preflight_input` error.

```elixir
{:ok, preflight} =
  Jidoka.preflight(MyApp.TimeAgent, "What time is it?",
    context: %{tenant_id: "acme"},
    request_id: "req-1"
  )

Enum.map(preflight.prompt.messages, & &1.role)
#=> [:system, :user]

preflight.prompt.operations
|> Enum.map(& &1.name)
#=> ["local_time"]

preflight.request.input
#=> "What time is it?"

preflight.diagnostics
#=> []
```

A non-empty `diagnostics` list flags issues the prompt assembler noticed
(missing memory entries, oversized tool descriptions, etc.).

### Step 4: Inspect Operation Metadata

When you need to confirm `controls do operation ... when: [...] end` will
match, project the operations:

```elixir
MyApp.TimeAgent
|> Jidoka.inspect()
|> Map.fetch!(:spec)
|> Map.fetch!(:operations)
|> Enum.map(&Map.take(&1, [:name, :idempotency, :metadata]))
```

The `metadata` map is the exact shape control `when:` clauses match
against (`:kind`, `:name`, `:source`, `:idempotency`, and any free-form
keys).

### Step 5: Project Turn Results And Journals

After a turn, project the result for assertions and external rendering.

```elixir
{:ok, result} = Jidoka.turn(MyApp.TimeAgent, "ping")

projected = Jidoka.project(result)
projected.content
#=> "now"

projected.journal.intent_count
#=> 1
```

`Jidoka.inspect(result)` returns a richer map with a `:timeline` and
`:status` already filled in - useful for log output during development.

### Step 6: Debug A Completed Request

`Jidoka.Debug.request/2` assembles one request-level view from a result,
session, snapshot, or replay. Use it when you want the prompt, operation
calls, usage, timeline, journal, and replay diagnostics in one place.

```elixir
{:ok, result} = Jidoka.turn(MyApp.TimeAgent, "What time is it?", llm: llm)

{:ok, summary} = Jidoka.Debug.request(result)

summary.request_id
summary.prompt.messages
summary.operation_names
summary.operation_results
summary.usage
summary.replay_diagnostics.status
#=> :complete
```

The summary is a typed `Jidoka.Debug.RequestSummary`:

```elixir
%Jidoka.Debug.RequestSummary{
  request_id: "turn_...",
  agent_id: "time_agent",
  status: :finished,
  model: "openai:gpt-4o-mini",
  input: "What time is it?",
  content: "It is 09:30 in Chicago.",
  context_keys: [],
  operation_names: ["local_time"],
  usage: %{llm_calls: 2, total_tokens: 184},
  replay_diagnostics: %Jidoka.Debug.ReplayDiagnostics{status: :complete}
}
```

The summary is data-only. It does not call an LLM, tool, memory store, or
runtime capability. For sessions, use `Jidoka.Debug.latest(session)` or pass
`request_id:` when you need a specific hibernated request. Unknown request ids
return `{:error, {:request_debug_not_found, session_id, request_id}}` instead
of falling back to the latest request.

For hibernated snapshots and sessions, the same call exposes pending review
data and incomplete effects:

```elixir
{:hibernate, session, snapshot} = Jidoka.Session.run(session, "Refund A1001")

{:ok, summary} = Jidoka.Debug.request(snapshot, session: session)

summary.status
#=> :waiting

summary.pending_reviews
#=> [%{operation: "refund_order", ...}]

summary.replay_diagnostics.status
#=> :waiting
```

### Step 7: Inspect A Snapshot Or Session

When a turn hibernates (typically because an operation control
returned `{:interrupt, _}`), `inspect/2` produces a snapshot view that
exposes the cursor, journal, and pending review request.

```elixir
case Jidoka.turn(MyApp.TimeAgent, "ping") do
  {:hibernate, snapshot} ->
    view = Jidoka.inspect(snapshot)
    view.kind
    #=> :snapshot

    view.cursor
    view.timeline

  {:ok, result} ->
    Jidoka.inspect(result)
end
```

For sessions, `Jidoka.inspect(session)` adds replay metadata, snapshot
count, pending reviews, and the latest cursor. Sessions are documented in
[Runtime And Execution Layers](runtime-and-harness.md); the inspection view is the
debugging entry point for them.

Replay diagnostics explain whether recorded effect data is complete:

```elixir
{:ok, replay} = Jidoka.Session.replay(session)
{:ok, diagnostics} = Jidoka.Session.Replay.diagnose(replay)

diagnostics.status
#=> :complete | :waiting | :failed | :incomplete
```

Status meanings:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `:complete` | Every recorded effect intent has a result. |
| `:waiting` | A human review request is still pending. |
| `:failed` | An effect result or timeline event failed. |
| `:incomplete` | At least one effect intent has no recorded result. |

### Step 8: Use Inspect For Logging

Because every view is a plain map, it serializes cleanly:

```elixir
require Logger

Logger.info(MyApp.TimeAgent |> Jidoka.inspect() |> :json.encode())
```

When you only want a subset, lower with `Jidoka.project/1` first and
`Map.take/2` the keys you care about. This is the recommended pattern for
production traces; `inspect/2` is the developer view.

## Common Patterns

- **Preflight before live calls.** The first sanity check for a new agent
  is `Jidoka.preflight(agent, "your prompt")`. If the messages and tool
  definitions look right, the live turn is much less likely to surprise
  you.
- **Snapshot views in failure logs.** When a session hibernates, log the
  result of `Jidoka.inspect(snapshot)`; the timeline plus pending review
  data is usually enough to diagnose stuck approvals.
- **Request summaries for user reports.** When a user says "that answer was
  wrong", capture `Jidoka.Debug.request(result)` so you have the prompt,
  operation results, usage, and replay diagnostics together.
- **Compare DSL and imported specs.** `Jidoka.inspect(dsl_module).spec ==
  Jidoka.inspect(imported_spec).spec` is the simplest parity assertion.
- **Inspect workflow modules before agent prompts.** If the workflow graph or
  parameters schema is wrong, fix it before debugging a model decision.
- **Strip identifiers in golden tests.** Use `Jidoka.project/1` and then
  drop generated id fields before snapshotting.
- **Never `IO.inspect/1` raw structs in production.** They print
  implementation detail; the inspection view is designed for callers.

## Testing

A typical preflight test asserts both the prompt content and the absence
of diagnostics.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.PreflightTest do
  use ExUnit.Case, async: true

  test "assembles a prompt for the time agent" do
    {:ok, preflight} = Jidoka.preflight(MyApp.TimeAgent, "What time is it?")

    system_message =
      Enum.find(preflight.prompt.messages, &(&1.role == :system))

    assert system_message.content =~ "Call local_time"
    assert Enum.find(preflight.prompt.operations, &(&1.name == "local_time"))
    assert preflight.diagnostics == []
  end

  test "inspect/1 returns a tagged map" do
    view = Jidoka.inspect(MyApp.TimeAgent)
    assert view.kind == :agent
    assert view.spec.id == "time_agent"
    assert is_list(view.spec.operations)
  end
end
```

Snapshot tests should generally compare against `Jidoka.project/1` output
rather than the full `inspect/2` view; projections are smaller and rotate
less between releases.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Jidoka.inspect(agent)` returns a plain projection without `:plan` | `Turn.Plan.new/1` failed for the spec. | Check the `:error` key in the view; it carries a normalized error from `Jidoka.error_to_map/1`. |
| `Jidoka.preflight/3` returns `{:error, %Jidoka.Error.Invalid{}}` | The supplied `context:` did not match the agent's `context` schema. | Either update the context or relax the schema; preflight runs the same `validate_context/2` as a real turn. |
| Memory does not appear in `preflight.prompt` | Preflight did not receive resolved memory. | Recall memory through the runtime or store, then pass the result as `resolved_memory:`. |
| `preflight.diagnostics` is non-empty | The prompt assembler flagged a warning (oversized description, missing schema). | Read the diagnostic and adjust the source; warnings here are runtime issues at slightly higher cost. |
| Turn result view has no `:timeline` entries | The turn never made a model or tool call. | Confirm the model returned an operation or final answer. |
