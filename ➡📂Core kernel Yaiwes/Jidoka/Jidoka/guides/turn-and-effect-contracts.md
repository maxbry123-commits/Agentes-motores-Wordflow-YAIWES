# Turn And Effect Contracts

A Jidoka turn is a pure data pipeline. The runtime compiles a `Jidoka.Agent.Spec`
into a `Jidoka.Turn.Plan`, threads a `Jidoka.Turn.State` through Runic, and
mediates external work through `Jidoka.Effect.Intent`/`Jidoka.Effect.Result`
pairs. This guide documents every data contract on that path so that custom
runners, traces, and storage layers can interoperate with the runtime without
guessing.

## When To Use This

- Use this guide when you are building a custom runner, sidecar, or trace
  exporter and need the on-the-wire shape of turn state and effects.
- Use this guide when reading a snapshot or journal in tests and needing to
  decode each field.
- Do not use this guide as a runtime walkthrough. See
  [Runtime And Execution Layers](runtime-and-harness.md) for the execution model.

## Prerequisites

- You have read [Agent Spec Contract](agent-spec-contract.md).
- You can build and run a Jidoka turn (see [Getting Started](getting-started.md)).

## Quick Example

A turn round-trip produces every contract this guide describes.

```elixir
alias Jidoka.Turn

spec = MyApp.TimeAgent.spec()
{:ok, plan} = Turn.Plan.new(spec)
{:ok, request} = Turn.Request.from_input("What time is it in Chicago?")

llm = fn _intent, _journal, _ctx ->
  {:ok, %{type: :final, content: "Chicago time is 09:30."}}
end

{:ok, result} = Jidoka.turn(MyApp.TimeAgent, request.input, llm: llm)

result.content              #=> "Chicago time is 09:30."
result.journal              #=> %Jidoka.Effect.Journal{intents: %{...}, results: %{...}}
hd(result.events).type      #=> :turn_started (or similar)
```

`plan`, `request`, the in-flight `Turn.State`, the `Turn.Result`, and the
`Effect.Journal` are all addressable, inspectable values.

                                          │ Turn.Result   │
                                          ╰───────────────╯
```

Three rules anchor the model:

1. The plan is derived from the spec; the state is derived from the plan plus a
   request.
2. The runtime only produces effects through `Effect.Intent` and consumes
   them through `Effect.Result`. The journal records both.
3. The final `Turn.Result` is projected from the terminal `Turn.State`.

### Loop Vocabulary And Counts

Jidoka uses four terms for loop work:

| Term | Exact meaning | Count rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User turn | One user request plus all model and tool work needed for its terminal result. | One successful `Jidoka.turn/3` result is one completed user turn. |
| Model step | One logical model decision inside a user turn. It returns a final answer or one tool-call group. | Count `:llm` intents in the turn journal. Provider retries and replay do not add steps. |
| Tool-call group | The one or more operation calls returned by one model step. All calls in a group must be independent. | Group operation intents by `request_id` and `loop_index`. A singular call is a group of one. |
| Dependent tool sequence | Two or more tool-call groups where a later model step can use an earlier result. | Count each group separately. It is still one user turn. |

`Jidoka.Loop.counts/1` returns portable logical counts. For example, three
independent calls followed by a final answer are one user turn, two model
steps, one tool-call group, and three tool calls. Two dependent calls followed
by a final answer are one user turn, three model steps, two tool-call groups,
and two tool calls.

The existing `max_model_turns` option name remains for compatibility. It limits
model steps, not user turns or tool calls.

## Fields

### `Jidoka.Turn.Plan`

Compiled execution defaults for one turn.

| Field | Type | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `spec` | `Agent.Spec.t()` | required | The immutable spec the plan was compiled from. |
| `max_model_turns` | positive integer | `spec.controls.max_turns` or `Jidoka.Config.default_max_model_turns/0` | Compatibility name for the upper bound on model steps in this user turn. |
| `timeout_ms` | positive integer | `spec.controls.timeout_ms` or `Jidoka.Config.default_turn_timeout_ms/0` | Hard wall-clock limit. |
| `metadata` | map | `%{}` | Plan-level metadata. |

Built by [`Jidoka.Turn.Plan.new/1`](`Jidoka.Turn.Plan`) which also runs
`Spec.validate_operation_policies/1` before returning.
The Runic compiler owns the fixed phase sequence. `Jidoka.project/1` derives
phase labels from that compiler instead of storing them in the plan.

### `Jidoka.Turn.Request`

Input envelope for one turn.

| Field | Type | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `input` | non-empty string | required | Text input or the derived text summary for multimodal input. |
| `content` | `[Jidoka.ContentPart.t()]` | `[]` | Ordered typed text and media input. |
| `request_id` | non-empty string | generated prefixed UUIDv7 (`"turn_…"`) | Stable id used by snapshots and logs. |
| `agent_state` | `Agent.State.t()` | empty agent state | Carries history across turns. |
| `context` | map | `%{}` | Per-turn context map (validated against `spec.context_schema`). |
| `metadata` | map | `%{}` | Caller metadata. |

`Turn.Request.from_input/2` accepts a string, an ordered content-part list, a
map, or a keyword list. A content-part list keeps its full typed form in
`content`. The request derives `input` from its text parts. If there is no text,
it uses a non-empty summary such as `"[Multimodal input: image, audio]"`. Input
controls, memory, and dynamic instructions continue to receive a stable string.

### `Jidoka.ContentPart`

Provider-neutral content for requests, messages, decisions, and results.

| Field | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | `:text \| :image \| :audio \| :video \| :document` | Content kind. |
| `text` | string or `nil` | Required for a text part. |
| `url` | string or `nil` | Remote media source. |
| `data` | binary or `nil` | Inline media source. |
| `file_id` | string or `nil` | Provider-managed media source. |
| `media_type` | string or `nil` | MIME type. Builders provide a default for each media type. |
| `filename` | string or `nil` | Optional provider filename. |
| `metadata` | map | Media or provider hints. |

A media part must have exactly one source: `url`, `data`, or `file_id`. Use the
builders to make this rule explicit:

```elixir
alias Jidoka.ContentPart

input = [
  ContentPart.text("Describe this image."),
  ContentPart.image({:data, image_bytes},
    media_type: "image/png",
    filename: "diagram.png"
  ),
  ContentPart.audio({:file_id, "file_123"}, media_type: "audio/mpeg")
]

{:ok, result} = Jidoka.turn(MyApp.MediaAgent, input)
```

The ReqLLM adapter sends supported parts as native ReqLLM content parts. Image
and video URLs stay as URLs. Inline media and file ids stay typed. ReqLLM does
not have a provider-neutral native form for audio or document URLs. The adapter
returns `{:unsupported_media_source, type, :url}` for those two cases. A
provider can still reject a valid native part when its selected model does not
support that media type. Jidoka returns that provider error without changing
it.

Raw media is durable data. Signed snapshots preserve it so resume is lossless.
`Jidoka.project/1`, debug prompt views, and terminal event data omit media
bytes, URLs, and file ids. They show the type, source kind, media type,
filename, byte size, and redacted metadata.

### `Jidoka.Turn.State`

Ephemeral value threaded through the workflow.

| Field | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `plan` / `request` | plan and request structs | Inputs to the loop. The plan owns the immutable agent specification. |
| `agent_state` | `Agent.State.t()` | Mutable accumulator (messages, operation results). |
| `memory` | `Memory.RecallResult.t() \| nil` | Most recent recall. |
| `prompt` | provider-neutral prompt or `nil` | Materialized prompt after assembly. |
| `llm_result` | `Effect.LLMDecision.t() \| nil` | Last decoded LLM decision. |
| `pending_effects` | `[Effect.Intent.t()]` | Effects awaiting interpretation. Operation batches are stored here in model order. |
| `pending_interrupt` | `Review.Interrupt.t() \| nil` | Review boundary, if any. |
| `result` / `result_parts` / `result_value` | string / content parts / term | Final assistant text, typed output, and validated structured value. |
| `result_repair_count` | non-negative integer | Repair attempts so far. |
| `status` | `:running \| :waiting \| :finished` | Loop state. |
| `loop_index` | non-negative integer | Zero-based model-step index. |
| `started_at_ms` | integer or `nil` | Wall-clock start. |
| `journal` | `Effect.Journal.t()` | Recorded intents and results. |
| `events` | `[Jidoka.Event.t()]` | Append-only event log. |
| `diagnostics` | list | Append-only diagnostic blobs. |

The legacy decoder discards copied `spec` and `operation_plan` fields. It uses
`plan.spec` and `pending_effects` as the current authorities.

Mutations go through [`Jidoka.Turn.Transition`](`Jidoka.Turn.Transition`).

### `Jidoka.Turn.Transition`

A pure transition value: new state plus pending events and diagnostics.

| Field | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `state` | map | The next state. |
| `events` | `[Jidoka.Event.t()]` | Events to append on commit. |
| `diagnostics` | list | Diagnostics to append on commit. |

`Transition.event/3` builds a [`Jidoka.Event`](`Jidoka.Event`) with stable
sequence ordering. `Transition.commit/1` folds events and diagnostics back into
the state.

### `Jidoka.Turn.Cursor`

A pointer to the next safe resume boundary.

| Field | Type | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `phase` | `:start \| :after_prompt \| :before_effect \| :review \| :wait` | `:start` | Logical phase boundary. |
| `loop_index` | non-negative integer | `0` | Loop round at hibernation time. |
| `metadata` | map | `%{}` | Boundary metadata (e.g. `effect_id`, `interrupt_id`). |

Constructors `after_prompt/0`, `before_effect/1`, `review/1` produce the
common cursor shapes.

### `Jidoka.Turn.Result`

Final app-facing value.

| Field | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `content` | string | Final assistant text. |
| `parts` | `[Jidoka.ContentPart.t()]` | Ordered typed text and media output. |
| `value` | term or `nil` | Validated structured value when `spec.result` is set. |
| `agent_state` | `Agent.State.t()` | Conversation state after the turn. |
| `journal` | `Effect.Journal.t()` | Effects observed during the turn. |
| `events` | `[Jidoka.Event.t()]` | Ordered event log. |
| `usage` | map | Aggregated LLM token and cost usage for the turn. |
| `metadata` | map | Caller metadata. |

Produced by [`Jidoka.Turn.Result.from_turn_state!/1`](`Jidoka.Turn.Result`)
once `status` reaches `:finished`.

A custom LLM capability can return typed output beside its final text:

```elixir
{:ok,
 %{
   type: :final,
   content: "Created the image.",
   parts: [
     Jidoka.ContentPart.text("Created the image."),
     Jidoka.ContentPart.image({:data, image_bytes}, media_type: "image/png")
   ]
 }}
```

The built-in ReqLLM capability converts provider image, video, audio, and file
parts into this contract. It also keeps provider metadata, response model,
finish reason, message metadata, and usage on the LLM decision and its journal
result.

When the LLM capability is backed by ReqLLM, `usage` contains normalized token
and cost fields when the provider returns them:

```elixir
result.usage
#=> %{
#=>   llm_calls: 2,
#=>   input_tokens: 800,
#=>   output_tokens: 240,
#=>   total_tokens: 1040,
#=>   reasoning_tokens: 0,
#=>   total_cost: 0.00048
#=> }
```

Per-call usage remains available in the journal:

```elixir
result.journal.results[effect_id].metadata.usage
```

### `Jidoka.Effect.Intent`

Data description of an external effect.

| Field | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | non-empty string | Stable id (`"<kind>:<idempotency_key>"`). |
| `kind` | `:llm \| :operation` | What the capability must do. |
| `payload` | map | Payload (normalized to an `Effect.OperationRequest` for `:operation`). |
| `idempotency_key` | non-empty string | Stable key (sha256 of `{kind, payload}` by default). |
| `idempotency` | `:pure \| :idempotent \| :dedupe \| :reconcile \| :unsafe_once` | Replay safety class. |
| `metadata` | map | Caller metadata. |

Build with `Effect.Intent.new/3` (kind + payload + opts) or `Intent.new/1` (full
map).

### `Jidoka.Effect.Result`

Normalized result of one interpreted effect.

| Field | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `intent_id` | non-empty string | The intent this result answers. |
| `kind` | `:llm \| :operation` | Mirrors the intent. |
| `status` | `:ok \| :error` | Interpreter outcome. |
| `output` | term | Decoded payload (LLM decision map for `:llm`; raw operation output for `:operation`). |
| `metadata` | map | Capability metadata. |

`Effect.Result.ok/2`, `Effect.Result.ok/3`, `Effect.Result.error/2`, and
`Effect.Result.error/3` are the convenience constructors. The third argument
accepts `metadata:` for capability-owned metadata such as LLM usage.

### `Jidoka.Effect.Journal`

Replay log keyed by intent id.

| Field | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `intents` | `%{String.t() => Effect.Intent.t()}` | Recorded intents. |
| `results` | `%{String.t() => Effect.Result.t()}` | Recorded results. |

Use `Journal.put_intent/2` and `Journal.put_result/2` to extend. Use
`Journal.result_for/2` to ask "has this intent already been satisfied?" - the
basis of replay safety.

### `Jidoka.Effect.OperationRequest` And `Jidoka.Effect.OperationResult`

Typed payload/observation pair for operation effects.

| `OperationRequest` field | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | non-empty string | Operation name from `Spec.Operation`. |
| `arguments` | map | Arguments decoded from the LLM decision. |
| `request_id` | string or `nil` | Source turn request id. |
| `loop_index` | non-negative integer | Loop round at planning time. |
| `metadata` | map | Caller metadata. |

| `OperationResult` field | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `operation` | non-empty string | Operation name. |
| `arguments` | map | Arguments used. |
| `output` | term | Raw observation. |
| `content` | string or `nil` | Pre-rendered message content. |
| `request_id` | string or `nil` | Turn request id. |
| `loop_index` | non-negative integer | Loop round. |
| `effect_id` | string or `nil` | Originating `Effect.Intent.id`. |
| `metadata` | map | Caller metadata. |

`OperationResult.from_effect/2` is the canonical bridge from an `Intent` +
capability output to a durable observation.

### `Jidoka.Effect.LLMDecision`

Constrained JSON decision protocol returned by every LLM capability.

| Field | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | `:final \| :operation \| :operations` | Branch of the decision protocol. |
| `content` | string or `nil` | Required for `:final`. Optional metadata text for operation decisions. |
| `parts` | list of `ContentPart` | Ordered typed model output. |
| `result` | term or `nil` | Structured result for `:final` when `spec.result` is set. |
| `name` | non-empty string or `nil` | Required for `:operation`. |
| `arguments` | map | Operation arguments. Required for `:operation`. |
| `operations` | list of `OperationRequest` | Ordered operation requests for `:operations`. |
| `metadata` | map | Provider metadata. |

`LLMDecision.final/2`, `LLMDecision.operation/3`, and
`LLMDecision.operations/2` are the builder helpers. Capabilities may return
either an `LLMDecision` struct or a map that `LLMDecision.from_input/1`
accepts.

## Common Patterns

- **Treat `Effect.Intent.id` as the only identity that matters.** The journal,
  cursor metadata, and `Effect.Result.intent_id` all key off it.
- **Decide once, observe once.** An LLM decision returns either one final
  answer, one operation intent, or one ordered operation batch. Each resulting
  intent is recorded and observed once.
- **Use the cursor for resume boundaries, not the state.** A cursor is small,
  serializable, and stable across versions; the state can carry rich data.
- **Prefer `LLMDecision` structs in fake LLMs.** Returning a map works (the
  runtime calls `LLMDecision.from_input/1`), but a struct catches typos sooner.

## Testing

A deterministic test asserts on the journal, not on the prompt.

```elixir
test "operation effect is recorded once" do
  llm = fn _intent, journal, _ctx ->
    case map_size(journal.results) do
      0 -> {:ok, Jidoka.Effect.LLMDecision.operation("local_time", %{"city" => "Chicago"})}
      _ -> {:ok, Jidoka.Effect.LLMDecision.final("Chicago time is 09:30.")}
    end
  end

  {:ok, result} = Jidoka.turn(MyApp.TimeAgent, "What time is it in Chicago?", llm: llm)

  operation_results =
    result.journal.results
    |> Map.values()
    |> Enum.filter(&(&1.kind == :operation))

  assert length(operation_results) == 1
end
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `{:error, {:effect_result_mismatch, _, _}}` | A capability returned a result whose `intent_id` does not match the current pending intent. | Ensure capabilities pass through the `Intent` they were given and only call `Effect.Result.ok/error` against it. |
| `{:error, {:invalid_llm_decision_type, _}}` | LLM output is missing or has a non-`:final`/`:operation`/`:operations` type. | Tighten the prompt or use the deterministic LLM path. |
| `{:error, {:unknown_operation, name}}` | Decision named an operation that is not in `spec.operations`. | Add the operation or change the model's allowed tools. |
| `Turn.State.status` stays `:waiting` forever | A `pending_interrupt` was not resolved. | Resume the snapshot through the review API before continuing. |
| `Turn.Result.events` is empty | The state was committed without any `Transition.event/3` calls. | Use `Turn.Transition` instead of mutating state directly. |
