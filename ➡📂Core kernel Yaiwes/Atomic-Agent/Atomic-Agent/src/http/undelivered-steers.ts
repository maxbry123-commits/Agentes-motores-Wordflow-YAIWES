/**
 * Parking lot for steering messages a turn handed back on
 * `RunTurnResult.undelivered`.
 *
 * `POST /api/sessions/{id}/steer` answers `200 {steered:true}` as soon
 * as the message is in the inbox, but acceptance is not delivery: a
 * steer that lands during the final inference — or into a turn that is
 * cancelled before its next step — comes back undelivered when the turn
 * closes, and `AgentLoop.flushSteering` empties the inbox as it reads.
 * The steer was its own HTTP exchange whose response was written long
 * before that, so there is nowhere to hand the text back to unless the
 * server keeps it. This store is that "somewhere": it is what makes the
 * HTTP surface hold the same invariant as the sidecar's
 * `steer_undelivered` event — the message you sent always goes
 * somewhere the host can see.
 *
 * Retrieval is deliberately **non-destructive**. `GET` lists, `DELETE`
 * acks by sequence number. A consuming read would lose the message to
 * any retried or prefetched request, which is the exact failure mode
 * this store exists to prevent; and because the ack carries a cursor
 * taken from the listing, a steer parked between the two calls has a
 * higher `seq` and survives the ack.
 *
 * The same reasoning applies to the loss counter. `discarded` is the
 * "N messages are gone" signal, and it is **not** covered by the entry
 * cursor — the discarded messages have no `seq` the host ever saw. It
 * therefore has its own ack ({@link UndeliveredSteerStore.ackDiscarded})
 * and keeps a session's box alive on its own, so acking the entries
 * cannot silently take the loss notice with them.
 *
 * Single-process, in-memory, one instance per HTTP server. Parked
 * messages do not survive a restart — neither does the inbox they came
 * from (`shutdown()` calls `SteeringInbox.clearAll`).

 * counts them, so a host that comes back late learns it lost some
