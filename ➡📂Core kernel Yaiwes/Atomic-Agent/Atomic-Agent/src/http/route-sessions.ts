 * running turn will pick the message up there is nothing to steer, and
 * the caller is told so with `409` rather than having the message
 * silently disappear — the correct follow-up is
 * `POST /v1/chat/completions`. `429` means the per-session steering
 * inbox is full; the turn has not read any of them yet, so piling on
 * more would only bloat one prompt.
 *
 * `runtime.steer` decides, and this route only translates. There is no
 * `turnController.isBusy` pre-check: "busy" and "a step boundary is
 * still coming" stop being true at different moments (the loop's final
 * drain happens inside `runTurn`, `busy.delete` later in the
 * controller's `finally`), so gating on it would reject steers the
 * runtime would have accepted. The inbox is consulted only after a
 * refusal, to choose between 409 and 429.
 *
 * `200 {steered:true}` means accepted, **not** delivered: the loop
 * drains the inbox at step boundaries, and a turn can end before the
 * next one. Anything left over is parked, not dropped — the turn hands
 * it back on `RunTurnResult.undelivered` and the route that ran the
 * turn puts it in the undelivered store, where
 * `GET /api/sessions/{id}/steer` finds it. That is the HTTP half of the
 * same promise the sidecar keeps with its `steer_undelivered` event.
