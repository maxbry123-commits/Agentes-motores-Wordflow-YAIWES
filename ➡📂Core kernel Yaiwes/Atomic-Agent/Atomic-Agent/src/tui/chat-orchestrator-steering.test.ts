/**

 *
 * `runOneTurn` sets `currentController` and *then* awaits
 * `runtime.runTurn`; `AgentLoop.runTurn` opens the window only once the
 * submission owns the per-session lock — after `turnController.enqueue`
 * has parked in `waitOrAbort` behind whatever is still settling on that
 * session. A message submitted in that span sees a turn in flight and a
 * shut window, so `steer` refuses it. It is still a correction aimed at
 * the turn the operator is watching, so it must not be demoted behind
 * backlog, and the operator must still be told it was taken as one.
 *
 * The harness runs the real `TurnController` and the real
 * `SteeringInbox`; only the loop body is stubbed, in the shape
 * `AgentLoop.runTurn` actually has (`open` on entry, `closeAndDrain` on
 * the way out, and a settle phase after it for the session save plus the
