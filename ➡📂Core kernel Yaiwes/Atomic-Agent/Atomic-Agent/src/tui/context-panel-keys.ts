 * here because a panel with almost no controls invites both.
 *
 * `a` switches the transcript cap to auto — the keyboard route to the
 * `set auto` button. Bound unconditionally rather than only when the
 * button is showing: the panel does not know whether it is, the
 * reducer's guard is the one that decides, and a key that silently did
 * nothing on the wrong screen is cheaper than two places disagreeing
 * about when it applies.
 *
 * Every other *bare* key is swallowed rather than passed on. The editor
 * is unfocused while the panel owns input, so a stray letter would go
 * nowhere visible and then surprise the operator when it turned up in
 * the buffer. Modified keys fall through untouched — `ctrl+c` still
 * aborts a running turn from here.
