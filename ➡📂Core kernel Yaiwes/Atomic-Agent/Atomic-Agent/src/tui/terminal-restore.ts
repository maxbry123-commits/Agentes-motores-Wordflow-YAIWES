/**
 * One place that knows how to hand the terminal back.
 *
 * The TUI puts the host terminal into two non-default modes — the
 * alternate screen (`alt-screen.ts`) and mouse reporting
 * (`mouse/mouse-tracking.ts`) — and each used to carry its own
 * `process.once("exit")` net. That covered a clean exit and nothing
 * else: an uncaught exception reached the reporter in
 * `error-reporting/error-reporter.ts`, which flushes Sentry for up to
 * two seconds and prints the stack, all of it *inside the alt screen*
 * with the mouse still reporting. The operator saw the crash text
 * scroll away with the alt buffer and was left in a shell where every
 * click printed `64;62;21M` at the prompt.
 *
 * So the two modes register here instead, and this module owns the
 * process hooks:
 *
 *  - `exit` — the original net, unchanged in effect.
 *  - `uncaughtException`, **prepended** — runs before the reporter, so
 *    the stack it prints lands on the normal screen and the terminal is
 *    already clean while Sentry flushes.
 *
 * Restores run **LIFO**: modes are undone in the reverse of the order
 * they were entered, so mouse reporting stops before the alt screen is
 * left rather than after it, and a throwing stream cannot stop the
 * restores behind it.
 *
 * `unhandledRejection` is deliberately absent. The reporter treats it
 * as non-fatal on purpose — a long-lived agent should not die of one —
 * and tearing the screen down under a TUI that keeps running would turn
 * an observability event into a visible fault.
 *
 * **What this cannot cover.** A V8 fatal error — `JavaScript heap out
 * of memory` is the one that bit us — calls `abort()` from inside the
 * engine. No JavaScript runs after it, so no handler here (or anywhere)
 * fires. The only defence against that is not running out of heap; see
 * the `process.env.NODE_ENV` define in `scripts/bundle-sea.ts`.
