/**
 * Hit-testing registry: turns a screen coordinate into the component
 * that owns that cell.
 *
 * Ink exposes no absolute positions — `measureElement` returns a size
 * only — but every rendered node keeps its Yoga node, and Yoga computes
 * each box's offset relative to its parent's border box. Ink's own
 * renderer walks the tree the same way (`render-node-to-output.ts`
 * accumulates `offsetX/offsetY` from `getComputedLeft/Top`), so summing
 * the chain up to the root reproduces exactly the cell the renderer
 * painted the node into. That equivalence is what makes clicking
 * reliable instead of a table of hardcoded row numbers that rots the
 * next time a panel gains a header line.
 *
 * Targets register a ref plus a handler; a click is offered to the
 * candidates whose rectangle contains the point, innermost first, until
 * one claims it. `minLayer` is the modal gate: while a modal owns the
 * keyboard, only targets registered at the modal layer are eligible, so
 * a click cannot reach the list rendered behind it.
