/**
 * Pre-turn readiness gate for the managed local backend.
 *
 * Without it a turn against a model that is not on disk burns the full
 * transport retry budget and then prints a bare `fetch failed`. The gate
 * answers ONE question just before a turn starts: "can the managed local
 * model serve this turn at all?" — and when it cannot, says which model,
 * whether it is coming down right now (live percent + bytes), and what
 * the operator actually presses to fix it.
 *
 * Scope (deliberately narrow):
 *  - managed mode only — external mode has no "on disk" notion, a dead
 *    external URL is a health problem the transport hint covers;
 *  - a `llama-server`-KIND active text provider only — cloud turns
 *    never gate;
 *  - with a fallback chain of more than one configured link the gate
 *    only leaves a notice: the chain exists to save exactly this turn,
 *    so blocking it would fight the failover that would have worked;
 *  - evaluated at TURN START, not enqueue — a message parked behind a
 *    running pull may be perfectly runnable by the time it drains.
