/**
 * Known OpenAI-compatible endpoints, so the operator picks a name
 * instead of typing a base URL from memory.
 *
 * These are not new provider kinds: every preset resolves to the
 * existing `openai-compatible` kind with `baseUrl` filled in. Model
 * lists still come from the server's own `/v1/models` (#31, #41), so
 * nothing here needs updating when a vendor ships a new model.
 *
 * ## Admission bar for a new preset
 *
 * Probe `<baseUrl>/v1/models` **with the exact headers this preset will
 * send** — the `apiKeyHeader` and `headers` below, not a bare
 * `Authorization: Bearer` — and accept only one of:
 *
 * 1. **200 with a `data` array.** Keyless listing; nothing left to prove.
 * 2. **401/403 that rejects the *credential*,** with a bogus key of the
 *    right shape in place. The body must complain about the key
 *    (`API key is invalid`), never about the request's shape.
 *
 * A 401 whose body names a header the preset does not send — Anthropic's
 * `x-api-key header is required`, a missing mandatory version header, an
 * "invalid bearer token" for what is an API key and not an OAuth token —
 * is a **failing** probe, not a passing one. It proves the path exists
 * and the auth is wrong, which is the exact condition that must keep a
 * preset out. Fix `apiKeyHeader`/`headers` until the body talks about the
 * key instead, or drop the preset. (Anthropic shipped under the old
 * wording, which read any 401 as "asking for a key": it was asking for a
 * header we never sent, and the preset could not authenticate at all.)
 *
 * Both branches additionally require the same host to answer **404 for a
 * bogus sibling path** — gateways that reject every request before
 * routing (z.ai, Cohere's compatibility root) prove nothing about
 * `/v1/models` and are deliberately absent. So is anything whose model
 * list does not live under `<root>/v1/models`: DeepInfra serves it at
 * `/v1/openai/models`, which this convention cannot express.
 * Re-verified 2026-08-20.
