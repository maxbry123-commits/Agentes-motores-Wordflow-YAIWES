 * Fit maths for the start-page splash — which brand mark to draw, how

 *
 * The splash used to be a fixed 83×20 mark plus the fixed tip rows,
 * i.e. it needed 90 columns and ~29 rows no matter what the terminal
 * offered. Ink 7 does not clip an over-tall frame — it overlaps
 * earlier lines (see `../row-window.ts`) — so a short window garbled
 * the whole start page, and a narrow one wrapped the artwork into
 * confetti.
 *
 * The mark has priority over the tip list: a window that grows tall
 * enough for a bigger mark spends its new rows on the artwork first, so
 * the tip count can legitimately drop across a variant change. Within a
 * variant the list only ever grows.
 *
 * This module is deliberately React-free so the breakpoints can be
 * unit-tested as a table instead of through rendered frames.
