/**
 * The composer: a framed input field with Send in it and a toolbar under
 * it.
 *
 * It used to be an opencode-style left "tail" — a single border column
 * down the left of the editor, capped by a `╹`. That reads as a quote
 * block, not as a place you type into, and it gave the two things the
 * composer needs to advertise (send, reference a file) nowhere to live.
 * A closed frame plus an action bar is the shape every operator already
 * knows from every other message box they have used, and it costs one
 * row *less* than the tail did: border, editor, bar, border — where the
 * tail spent a top pad, a blank row above the meta and the cap glyph.
 *
 * Send sits **inside** the field, on the right of the buffer row, rather
 * than on the bar under it: it is the verb for the text beside it, and
 * keeping it out of the bar leaves that row free for the status readouts
 * the chat surface passes in.
 *
 * The frame is deliberately the app's only fully-boxed surface besides
 * modals. Bounded height matters: Ink 7 does not clip a frame taller
 * than the terminal, it overlaps the lines above it (the hazard
 * `splash-fit.ts` exists to document), so the composer grows only with
 * the buffer the operator typed and never with its own chrome.
 *
 * Out-of-scope (deferred for parity with opencode):
 *   - bracketed paste with image bytes (Ink delivers cooked stdin)
 *   - extmark "chips" inside the textarea (e.g. coloured `@file.ts`)
 *   - alpha / fade-in animations on the action bar
 *
 * The shell does **not** open the autocomplete popup — slash-palette
 * stays where it lived before, rendered by the parent above the editor.

        It used to rely on the buffer being *uncoloured* — inheriting the
        terminal's default ink — and that assumption only holds while the
        panel and the terminal are on the same side of the light/dark
        line. They need not be: `classic-light` paints `#dde4f4` here, so
        anyone running a light palette in a dark terminal typed light
        text onto a light panel and could not read what they were
        writing. The ink is measured against the ground now, the same way
