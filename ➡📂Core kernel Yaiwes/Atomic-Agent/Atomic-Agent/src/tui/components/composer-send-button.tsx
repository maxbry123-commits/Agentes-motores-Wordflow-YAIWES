 * and it spent the one slot on the bar that a status readout wants. In
 * the field it stays at the same column and lands next to the caret.
 *
 * Every colour here is a *pair* taken from the theme rather than a
 * literal, and the pair is one the palette already guarantees to be
 * opposite: `chipBackground` against `chipForeground`. That is what
 * keeps the chip legible across all eleven palettes without a per-theme
 * table — the tokens flip polarity with the theme.
 *
 * A disabled Send drops to `badgeBackground` / `muted`, which is the
 * terminal's version of a ghost button: still there, still labelled,
 * visibly not pressable.
