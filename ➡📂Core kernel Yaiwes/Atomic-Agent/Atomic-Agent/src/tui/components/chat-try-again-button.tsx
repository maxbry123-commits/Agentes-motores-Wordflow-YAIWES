/**
 * Re-run `text` exactly as if it had been typed into the composer and
 * submitted with Enter.
 *
 * **One submit path.** Everything goes through `handleEditorSubmit`, the
 * function Enter calls, so a re-run inherits whatever routing the
 * operator has configured instead of inventing a third behaviour: idle
 * starts a turn; while a turn is running `tui.whileBusySubmit` (Ctrl+T)
 * decides between steering the text into the turn in flight and parking
 * it in the queue. The same rule covers the odd cases for free — a
 * message that happens to read as a slash command runs as one, because
 * that is what typing it would do, and a second interpretation of the
 * same text is exactly how two submit paths drift apart.
 *
 * **The composer draft survives.** Every landing that path dispatches
 * blanks `inputValue` — `startNewRun`, `message_queued` and
 * `message_steered` all do — which would silently eat a half-written
 * message the operator had not sent yet. The draft is snapshotted before
 * the submit and written back after it, so a re-run costs a turn and
 * nothing else. Restoring the buffer alone is enough: a draft that would
 * also need slash-palette state restored cannot reach this handler at
 * all, because `TuiApp` raises the mouse floor to `MOUSE_LAYER_MODAL`
 * while the palette is open and this button sits on the base layer.

/**
 * The per-message "run that again" affordance, beside `[copy]`.
 *
 * **Only user messages get one**, which is `chat-log.tsx`'s call to
 * make, not this component's — but the reasoning belongs next to the
 * code it explains. A user message is a command someone gave the agent,
 * so re-running it is a real intent: the model wandered off, a file
 * changed, a tool was down. An assistant message is the agent's own
 * prose; sending it back would open a turn whose prompt is the previous
 * answer, which is not "try again" in any sense an operator means. A
 * system message is TUI runtime output — queue listings, turn-failed
 * lines — and re-sending one as a prompt is worse than nonsense. Asking
 * the model to have another go at the *same* question is a different
 * feature (it has to drop the last turn, not append one) and it is not
 * this button.
 *
 * **Why a badge when the click already changes the screen.** Often it
 * does not. A steered message is not rendered until the loop applies it
 * at the next step boundary (`steer_applied`), which can be seconds
 * away, so a click with no feedback reads as a dead button and gets
 * clicked again. `[sent]` closes that gap and doubles as the guard:
 * clicks are ignored while it is up, so the double-click a terminal
 * reports as two presses cannot open two turns.
 *
 * **Without a mouse provider** (component tests, `--no-mouse`) it still
 * renders, exactly like `[copy]` — a legible hint that the affordance is
 * there when the mouse is on — but registers no target.
