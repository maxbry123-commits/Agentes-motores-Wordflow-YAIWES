 * Every path here ends in something that already existed: a provider or
 * a model row goes through `triggerLlmPrimary`, which is the LLM tab's
 * own Enter, and therefore reaches `ProvidersOrchestrator.setActiveText`
 * / `.selectChatModel` through the same callbacks the tab uses. Nothing
 * in this file writes config or touches the provider registry itself.
 *
 * The two backends that need a surface the composer does not own — the
 * provider wizard and the external base-URL editor — first send the
 * operator to Manage › LLM, where those modals are rendered. Opening a
 * modal that only the LLM tab draws while the operator is looking at the
 * chat would be a keypress with no visible effect.
