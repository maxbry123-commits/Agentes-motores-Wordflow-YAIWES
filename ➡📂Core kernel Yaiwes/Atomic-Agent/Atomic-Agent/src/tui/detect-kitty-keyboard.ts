/**
 * Does this terminal speak the kitty keyboard protocol?
 *
 * It matters for exactly one reason: in the legacy encoding a terminal
 * sends the same byte (`\r`) for Enter and for Shift+Enter, so the
 * modifier is not observable and Shift+Enter cannot mean "newline". The
 * kitty protocol encodes it as `ESC [ 13 ; 2 u`, which Ink's parser
 * already turns into `key.return` + `key.shift`.
 *
 * The probe is the protocol's own query — `CSI ? u` — answered by
 * `CSI ? <flags> u`. Terminals that do not implement it answer nothing,
 * which is why this is a timeout rather than an error.
 *
 * Ink can auto-detect this itself (`kittyKeyboard: { mode: "auto" }`),
 * but its probe listener and the App's own reader both see the reply,
 * so the answer can be typed into the composer as `[?1u` before the
 * first render. Asking here — before `render`, on a stdin we hand back
 * exactly as we found it — keeps the reply out of the app entirely, and
 * gives the hint strip something to tell the truth with.
 *
 * The safety properties mirror `detectTerminalBackground`, deliberately:
 * never touch raw mode off a TTY, restore raw/flow state, resolve once,
 * and never keep the event loop alive for a probe.
