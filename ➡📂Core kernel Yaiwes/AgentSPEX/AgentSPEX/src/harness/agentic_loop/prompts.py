        "Use `step` when subsequent instructions need conversation history.\n"

        "expecting structured data, explicitly instruct the LLM to return ONLY "
        "a JSON array or object — `save_as` captures raw text.\n"
        "4. `while` loops MUST have `max_iterations` and an exit mechanism "
        "(e.g., `increment`).\n"
        "5. Per-step model override is NOT supported. To use a different model "
        "for specific steps, use `call` to a submodule with its own `config.model`.\n"
        "6. `task` supports per-step `system_prompt`; `step` does NOT.\n"
        "7. Default `max_tool_calls_per_step` is 10. If a step needs more "
        "tool calls, set it in `config`.\n\n"
        "## Model Naming Rules\n\n"
        "Use ONLY short model names. Do NOT use dated slugs.\n"
