# Recurrent-Depth Transformers: controlled experiments on looped inference

Recurrent-depth transformers reuse one weight-tied block N times instead of stacking N distinct blocks (the Universal Transformer / Huginn / Ouro line), trading parameter count for inference-time compute. This repository reports controlled experiments on when the extra inference loops add capability that width does not already provide.

Two results are below; the rest — sharpness, a mechanism probe, a cross-architecture comparison, composition, and the negatives — is in [`writeup/`](writeup/) and [`NEGATIVE_RESULTS.md`](NEGATIVE_RESULTS.md). Everything is small-scale and seed-pinned: controlled studies, not production-LLM claims.

## Architecture

The model follows the Prelude–Core–Coda (Huginn) shape: unique pre-layers, one weight-tied core block applied N times, and unique post-layers.

```
tokens --> [ prelude ] --> [ core ] --> [ coda ] --> logits
                           ^       |
                           +-------+  x N
```

Prelude and coda are ordinary distinct layers; the core is a single weight-tied block reused on each of the N loops (`n_prelude` + core×N + `n_coda`).

- N is fixed during training. At inference, depth is either a fixed count or, in Result 2, set per example by a halt rule combined with multi-pass decoding.
- The base model uses no per-loop conditioning: no loop-index embedding is provided to the core, so an unconditioned shared block receives no external signal indicating which loop it is executing. This is relevant when interpreting the loop dynamics.

## Code

| path | contents |
|---|---|
| [`src/model.py`](src/model.py) | reference implementation of the architectures (vanilla / looped / pcc / gated / …) |
| [`src/archlab/`](src/archlab/) | synthetic task generators (`data_*.py`) and the controlled iterative-target experiments behind Result 1 |
| [`src/pretrain/`](src/pretrain/) | training loop, iterative-target supervision, the LoRA + multi-pass recipe (`stage2_ft.py`), halt rule, and the probes |

## Tasks

The extrapolation experiments use small synthetic sequence tasks for which the result after `r` steps is well-defined, giving a ground-truth target for applying the loop `r` times. Extrapolation past the trained depth tracks one property — whether the per-step rule depends on the loop index — with graph BFS showing that this condition is necessary but not sufficient (Result 1).

These are synthetic generators written for this study, not benchmark datasets with published baselines.

| task | per-step rule | generator | position-invariant? | extrapolates past trained depth? |
|---|---|---|:---:|:---|
| **chain** (pointer walk) | each symbol points to a fixed next symbol; take one hop | [`data_chain.py`](src/archlab/data_chain.py) | yes | yes, to ~24× |
| **arithmetic reduction** | reduce the leftmost `(a, op, b)` triple to one value | [`data_arith.py`](src/archlab/data_arith.py) | yes | yes (3–12×) |
| **modular** | running sum mod `p`: `s ← (s + v_r) mod p` | experiment scripts | yes | yes, with noise injection (4–16×) |
| **graph BFS** | expand the reachable set one hop: `next[i] = cur[i] OR ∃j (adj[i,j] AND cur[j])` | [`data_bfs.py`](src/archlab/data_bfs.py) | yes | partial — capped near 50% by its multi-token state |
| **parity** | cumulative XOR of the first `r` bits | [`data_parity.py`](src/archlab/data_parity.py) | **no** (depends on `r`) | no — walls at the trained depth |

## Result 1 — supervision, not architecture, determines length extrapolation

Training the same looped model under two supervision schemes produces opposite behaviour beyond the trained depth.

- Supervising only the final loop teaches the model to terminate; accuracy walls at the trained loop count.
- Supervising every loop against the partial result after that many steps (iterative-target) teaches the model to iterate; accuracy is retained beyond the trained depth — to approximately 24× the trained loop count on the chain task, and to varying degrees on the other position-invariant tasks (see the Tasks table).

The boundary is governed by a position-invariance condition, and it includes a control that fails as predicted. Extrapolation requires the per-step rule to be a function of state rather than of the loop index. Parity, whose per-step rule depends on the loop index, walls exactly at the trained depth under either supervision scheme — the failing control that distinguishes this from an unfalsifiable observation. Graph BFS marks the other edge of the boundary: its rule is position-invariant, yet its multi-token state caps accuracy near 50%, so position-invariance is necessary but not sufficient.

## Result 2 — inference compute can be set per example after training

Because iterative-target supervision installs genuine iteration, the trained loop count does not bound the inference loop count. After a short LoRA fine-tune (approximately 31K trainable parameters), running inference as multiple passes with a hardcoded halt rule (stop when the cumulative loop count reaches the requested depth) allows the inference compute to be set per example.

- 100% accuracy at a requested depth up to 256× the trained depth on the synthetic chain task.
- No learned halt head is required; the hardcoded rule matches a trained one.

This reproduces the adaptive-compute pattern — allocating more inference compute to harder inputs — at the recurrent-depth level. It is a controlled-scale demonstration on a synthetic task and is not a language-modeling result.

Details: [`writeup/02-test-time-compute.md`](writeup/02-test-time-compute.md); the minimal recipe is in [`writeup/05-production-recipe.md`](writeup/05-production-recipe.md).

## How the four architectures compare (sub-1B, real text)

Two recurrent (**PCC**, **xloop**) and two dense (**vanilla**) models, pretrained on the same 50B-token mixture. Token budgets are **not** matched (column below), so every cross-model difference here is correlational, not causal.

> Why unequal tokens: pretraining was run as a chain of resumable sessions constrained by a fixed per-session compute limit, rather than to a fixed token budget. Throughput also varies by architecture and size — recurrent looping and larger width both add compute per step — so under the same session limits the models reached different token totals. A fully token-matched retrain is the primary follow-up.

| model | params | tokens | val loss ↓ | sharpness κ ↓ | Q/K/V cross-loop cos | HARD50 maj / best-of-K@20 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|:---:|---:|
| PCC 356M | 356M | 31B | 1.763 | 32.8 | 0.97 / 0.98 / 0.86 | 52% / 78% |
| xloop 356M | 356M | 25B | 1.795 | 27.6 | 0.86 / 0.89 / 0.62 | 50% / 78% |
| vanilla 500M | 508M | 41B | **1.695** | 22.2 | ≈ 0 (distinct blocks) | **62% / 90%** |
| vanilla 912M | 912M | 19B | **1.657** | **12.1** | ≈ 0 (distinct blocks) | 90% at K=100 |

- **Loss & geometry.** The dense models reach lower validation loss *and* flatter minima; sharpness (κ) rises monotonically with weight-tying strength.
- **Mechanism.** In the recurrent models, applying the shared `W_Q/W_K/W_V` across loops gives near-identical Q, K, and V (all three cohere) — consistent with the hidden state reaching a fixed point of the core, so loops past a few add little. Distinct-block vanilla has orthogonal projections (cos ≈ 0).
- **Reasoning.** On GSM8K the per-checkpoint noise is ±0.6pp and all four sit inside it — no architecture wins. On the internal HARD50 multi-step set the dense 500M leads, and its sampling-TTC (best-of-K 90%) matches the 912M.

Against the published recurrent-depth baseline (`lm-eval-harness`, n=400/task):

| model | params | ARC-E | ARC-C | HellaSwag | Winogrande |
|---|---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| PCC 356M | 356M | 51.5 | 26.8 | 33.7 | 53.5 |
| vanilla 912M | 912M | 57.5 | 30.2 | 40.8 | 56.5 |
| Huginn-3.5B (published, 800B tok) | 3.5B | **69.9** | **38.2** | **65.2** | **59.4** |

Huginn saw ≈20–30× the tokens; none of the matched-data models reach it, and the gap tracks token budget rather than architecture.

Results 1–2 are on synthetic algorithmic tasks. Full detail: [`writeup/08-cross-architecture-phase2.md`](writeup/08-cross-architecture-phase2.md) and [`NEGATIVE_RESULTS.md`](NEGATIVE_RESULTS.md).
