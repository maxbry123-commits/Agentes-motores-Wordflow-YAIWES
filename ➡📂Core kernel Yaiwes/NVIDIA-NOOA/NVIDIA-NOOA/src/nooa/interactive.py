"""Interactive agent base: queue-driven turn loop, persistent vars, summarization.

``InteractiveAgent`` is the base class for agents driven by an outer
dispatcher — a terminal UI, a harness, or any host that feeds input
queues and re-enters ``handle()`` once per notification. It provides:

* ``self.user_messages`` via ``QueueManager``; hosts declare whatever further
  queues they need (``self.queue_manager.queue("name")``),
* ``self.v`` — snapshot-backed persistent variables that survive turns
  and sessions,
* ``message()`` — send a Markdown message to the user,
* the ``handle()`` → ``RespondResult`` turn protocol,
* token-budget history summarization (``install_summarizer`` /
  ``apply_model_limits``).

``nooa_cli.coding.CodingAgent`` adds the shared coding tools used by
interactive hosts such as the TUI and ACP.

        ## Turn anatomy

        Notification is always ``dict[str, list]`` — channel name →
        list of items that arrived since last turn::

            msgs = notification.get("user_messages", [])
            lines = notification.get("ci", [])

        ## Work ethic

        Do ALL the work before returning. Use as many ``execute_python``
        calls as needed — explore, implement, test, iterate. A turn that
        returns after one or two cells when the task clearly needs more
        is a bug. The only reasons to call ``return_result`` are:

        1. You have genuinely completed everything the user asked for.
        2. You need user input to proceed (ambiguity, confirmation).
        3. You are waiting on a background job.

        ## Returning

        End the turn with exactly one ``return_result(REASON_ENUM, explanation="...")``.
        ``explanation`` is required and must be non-empty. The host records and renders it as the
        visible stop reason, so be specific and user-facing: if waiting on a
        job/queue, name which job and why; if asking for input, say what input
        is needed and why.

        - Request complete; wait for the next user message::

              return_result(RespondReason.DONE, explanation="implemented the feature and verified focused tests")

        - Need human input before proceeding::

              return_result(RespondReason.NEED_INPUT, explanation="need the target branch before pushing the MR")

        - Waiting for a background job or producer queue::

              return_result(RespondReason.WAIT, explanation="waiting for pytest job ci-42 to finish before reporting results")

        All stop reasons use the same dispatcher wake path: the host races every
        declared queue/event channel and re-enters ``handle()`` with the first
        arrival. Use ``kind`` to say why you are stopping, not to select a
        different queue primitive.



        ## Available queues

        The dispatcher delivers the next item via ``notification``.
        You can also dequeue extra items mid-turn (without ending it)
        by awaiting the queue directly::

            extra = await self.user_messages.get()  # blocks until next message

        Recognized ``queue_name`` values:

        - ``"user_messages"`` — text from the human; ``item`` is a str.

        Hosts declare the rest. ``CodingAgent`` adds ``"slash_commands"``
        (``SlashCommandResult``) and ``"system_messages"`` (host-owned
        prompts such as keep-going continuations); a harness might add
        ``"job_outputs"``. The
        ``<queue_status>`` context block lists the pending count per
        queue each turn. After any stop reason, the dispatcher races every
        declared queue/event and re-enters with the first arrival.
