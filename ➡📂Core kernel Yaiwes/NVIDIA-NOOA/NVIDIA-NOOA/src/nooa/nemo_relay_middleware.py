"""NeMo Relay integration via the ``intercept()`` middleware API.

When ``nemo_relay`` is installed, this module provides three middleware functions
that route LLM calls, code execution, and agent method calls through the NeMo Relay
pipeline (guardrails, intercepts, event subscribers, ATIF export).

Usage::

    from nooa.nemo_relay_middleware import install_nemo_relay

    # Inside an async context where nemo_relay scope is active:
    uninstall = install_nemo_relay(agent.event_manager)
    try:
        result = await agent.my_method()
    finally:
        uninstall()

Or use ``nemo_relay_scope()`` which handles install/uninstall automatically::

    from nooa.nemo_relay_middleware import nemo_relay_scope

    async with nemo_relay_scope(agent, "my-agent"):
        result = await agent.my_method()

Requirements:
    ``nemo_relay`` must be installed (``uv sync --extra nemo-relay``).
    If not installed, ``install_nemo_relay()`` and ``nemo_relay_scope()`` raise
    ``ImportError`` with install instructions.

    Pushes a ``ScopeType.Function`` scope named ``"AgentClass.method_name"``
    before the method executes and pops it after, giving ATIF per-method
    granularity.

    Concurrency
    -----------
    NeMo Relay keeps a single mutable LIFO scope stack in a ContextVar, and
    child asyncio tasks inherit it *by reference*.  Two agent calls that
    overlap in time (e.g. ``asyncio.gather(self.a(), self.b())`` in generated
    code) therefore interleave their pushes on one stack, and whichever
    finishes first cannot pop — ``pop()`` rejects any handle that is not on
    top.  The stack is then permanently desynchronised: scopes never emit end
    events, later scopes reparent under the leaked one, and the root pop
    raises out of :func:`nemo_relay_scope`.

    The fix is to give a concurrently-dispatched call its own scope stack, so
    its pushes and pops can never interleave with a sibling's.  Parent linkage
    survives isolation because ``scope.push(handle=...)`` accepts an explicit
    parent handle from another stack.  A call that runs in the *same* task as
    its parent keeps the shared stack — sequential nesting is already correct,
    and staying on the shared stack preserves ``scope_local`` registrations
    made on ancestor scopes.

    Known limitation: a concurrently-dispatched call runs on its own stack, so
    ``nemo_relay.scope_local`` registrations made on an *ancestor* scope do not
    apply to it.  Global guardrails/intercepts/subscribers are unaffected, as
    are scope-locals registered on the call's own scope.  Overlapping calls
    previously corrupted the stack outright, so this is strictly an
    improvement, but it is a real behavioural difference worth knowing.
