"""Storage manager protocol for agent persistence.

Defines the StorageManager interface — the single object users pass to
agents for full persistence support. It centralizes persistable events
(via an EventBackend) and state snapshots.

The Agent owns its EventManager; storage owns only the EventBackend
underneath. This separation means swapping storage (``/clear``,
``/session new``, etc.) preserves subscribers and middleware on the
agent's stable EventManager — only the persistence target changes.

    Implementations centralize all agent storage:
    - Event persistence (owns the EventBackend)
    - Snapshot save and restore

    The StorageManager is the single object users pass to agents
    for full persistence support.

    Both ``save_snapshot`` and ``restore_snapshot`` receive the agent
    directly. The implementation reads/writes the agent's internals
    however it sees fit (JSON, DB rows, protobuf, etc.).

    Example (``PostgresStorageManager`` is a hypothetical
    implementation shown only to illustrate the interface; the storage
    backend shipped with this package is ``SQLiteStorageManager``)::

        storage = PostgresStorageManager("postgresql://...")
        agent = MyAgent(storage=storage)

        # Events stream automatically through agent.event_manager,
        # which writes to storage.event_backend. Snapshot explicitly:
        snapshot_id = storage.save_snapshot(agent)

        # Restore into a freshly constructed agent:
        agent = MyAgent(storage=storage)
        storage.restore_snapshot(snapshot_id, agent)
