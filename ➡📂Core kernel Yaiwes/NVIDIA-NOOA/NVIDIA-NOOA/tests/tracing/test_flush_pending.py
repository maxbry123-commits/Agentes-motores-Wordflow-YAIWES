"""Tests for ``flush_pending`` -- the journal callback's daemon-thread join.

The eval pipeline's process-exit race truncated journal POSTs at the
receiver because ``_post_json`` dispatches into daemon threads and the
calling process can exit before they finish.  ``JournalExporter.force_flush``
calls ``flush_pending`` to block on those threads.  This module covers
the join behaviour directly, including the append-vs-start race that
the original implementation got wrong.
