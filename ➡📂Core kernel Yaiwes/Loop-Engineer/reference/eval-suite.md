# Eval Suite — measuring a loop you can trust

Reference for [[loop-evals]] (designs the suite) and [[loop-flywheel]] (feeds failures back into it). A loop without measurement is a loop that *claims* success; this file defines how `loop-engineer` proves it. The suite is the proof layer of the repo-OS contract in `reference/repo-os-contract.md` — it lands as `scripts/verify-*` + `EVALS/{dataset,rubrics,regressions,traces}/` inside the loop's workspace, never in a vendor eval UI.

Design rule of the whole suite: **a model score may only ever ADD a failure, never clear a deterministic one.** Every layer below is ordered so the cheap, binary, ungameable checks gate the expensive, judgment-laden ones.

---

## 1. The seven layers

Each layer answers a different question, runs at a different cost, and emits one or more key metrics. `loop-evals` selects which layers a given loop needs from its `SPEC.md` (a read-only refactor needs layers 1/4/6/7; a money-moving agent adds 3/5 as blocking). Layers 1–2 run every iteration; 3–7 run on a schedule (see §6).

| # | Layer | Mechanism | Key metric(s) | Blocking? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Deterministic correctness | tests, lint, typecheck, schema/contract validation — `scripts/verify-fast` then `scripts/verify-full` | pass rate, constraint-violation count | **Yes** (hard gate) |
| 2 | Artifact quality | rubric-based model judge against a **fixed schema** (`EVALS/rubrics/`) | rubric mean, per-dimension score | No (advisory) |
| 3 | Human calibration | adjudicated sample review of judge verdicts | judge↔human agreement, false-accept / false-reject rate | Gate on the *judge*, not the run |
| 4 | Loop behavior | trace analysis over runs (`EVALS/traces/`, `RUNLOG.md`, `.loop/receipts/*.jsonl`) | plan compliance, repair depth, **premature-stop / false-completion rate** | No (advisory + alarm) |
| 5 | Security / governance | red-team scenarios, approval tests, prompt-injection probes | escape rate, approval-bypass rate, verifier-gaming detections | **Yes** for high-risk loops |
| 6 | Regression resistance | repo-native regression dataset + trace-derived cases (`EVALS/regressions/`) | regression failure count (must be 0) | **Yes** once a scorecard is frozen |
| 7 | Cost / efficiency | token / latency / tool logs from receipts | cost-per-success, wall-clock-to-success | No (budget alarm) |

Layer 1 is the spine: it is exactly the contract's `scripts/verify-fast`→`verify-full` gate (see Reuse below), not a new engine. Layers 2–3 are the judge stack. Layer 4 is where the two first-class metrics in §2 live. Layer 5 is the anti-cheat surface detailed in `reference/safety-and-approvals.md`. Layers 6–7 are the durability and budget guards.

**Why this layering.** Long-horizon agentic-coding work fails first at *self-verification*, not at code generation — SWE-Marathon reports sub-30% success on ultra-long-horizon tasks, dominated by agents declaring victory their own verifier would reject. Deterministic layers 1/6 are the only ones an agent cannot talk its way past, so they gate everything; the judge layers 2/3 add nuance on top but are never permitted to overturn a layer-1 failure.

---

## 2. The two first-class metrics

Most eval harnesses track pass-rate and stop. The two metrics below are the ones that actually predict whether a *loop* (not a single attempt) is healthy, and they are promoted to first-class status — every loop reports them in its scorecard, and [[loop-flywheel]] watches their trend.

### 2.1 false-completion-rate (FCR)

**Definition.** The fraction of iterations (or runs) where the agent **declared the task complete while the deterministic verification layer disagrees** — i.e. it reached a self-asserted "done" but layer-1/layer-6 evidence shows ≥1 unmet `success_criteria` or a constraint violation.

```
FCR = (iterations claiming success AND failing deterministic verify)
      ----------------------------------------------------------------
                  (iterations claiming success)
```

- Computed from `RUNLOG.md` self-reports cross-joined with the layer-1 verification bundle for the same `iteration_id`. A claim of "Succeeded" that is not backed by a green `scripts/verify-full` run is a false completion, full stop.
- **Target: 0.** Any non-zero FCR is a defect in the loop's *stopping rule*, not in the task — it means the terminal-state machine is trusting narration over evidence.
- This is the direct, numeric guard against the prime-directive failure mode: a loop that cannot verify must terminate `FailedUnverifiable`, never silent-"completed". A rising FCR is the earliest signal that a loop is drifting toward verifier-blindness; a detected *deliberate* false completion (e.g. the agent edited a test to pass) is escalated by Layer 5 to a verifier-gaming hard-terminate, not just counted here.
- **Measured, not narrated — the runnable split.** `loop-engineer` ships the held-out verifier split as composable tooling: `scripts/holdout_gate.py` certifies `Succeeded` only when a withheld **holdout** check set passes, not just the **visible** set the loop optimized against, and emits a `false_completion` flag when the visible set passes while the holdout fails. Aggregated across runs, that flag *is* FCR — no longer a self-reported number. Pair it with `scripts/anticheat_scan.py` (the post-`Succeeded` trajectory sweep, `reference/safety-and-approvals.md` §6).

### 2.2 repair-productivity (RP)

**Definition.** The fraction of repair passes that **measurably improve the score** versus passes that churn (no measurable improvement, or regression) — the health metric for [[loop-repair]].

```
RP = (repair passes where verification_after > verification_before)
     -------------------------------------------------------------
                  (total repair passes attempted)
```

- "Improvement" is read straight off the structured repair-record schema [[loop-repair]] emits: `verification_before` vs `verification_after` on the same metric (a layer-1 pass count, a layer-2 rubric dimension, or a closed `remaining_delta`). A pass that leaves `remaining_delta` unchanged is churn.
- **The canonical repair record is RP's only input.** RP reads *the repair record* — `schemas/repair-record.schema.json` (`loop-engineer/repair@1`), on disk at `.loop/repair/<iteration_id>.json`, the `verification_before`/`verification_after.score` pass [[loop-repair]] emits. The append-only **rollout / candidate ledger** (`schemas/rollout-record.schema.json`, `loop-engineer/rollout@1`, `scripts/rollout_ledger.py`) is a *separate* artifact that adjudicates rollout candidates; its `productive` is a rollout-productivity flywheel view, **not** the RP baseline. Neither is trusted verbatim: `scripts/metrics.py` recomputes `productive` (`recheck_productive`) from the record's own evidence and rejects any record whose stored flag disagrees, so RP is aggregated only over validated records.
- **Target: high and trending up.** Low RP means the repair loop is thrashing — it is hitting its max-N cap (default N=2, per `WORKFLOW.md`) and burning budget without converging. Low RP is the data-driven trigger for the escalation ladder's "same failure mode repeats without measurable improvement → re-plan" rung (see `reference/safety-and-approvals.md`).
- RP and the repair max-N cap are complementary: the cap bounds *how many* repairs run; RP measures whether those repairs were *worth* running. A loop with a healthy cap but RP≈0 is still broken.

Both metrics are derived, not self-reported: FCR comes from joining claims to deterministic evidence, RP from the before/after fields in repair records. Neither can be inflated by the agent narrating confidence.

## 3. Deterministic-first, then rubric

The non-negotiable ordering inside every evaluation cycle:

1. **Run the deterministic gate first** (Layer 1: `verify-fast` → `verify-full` → schema/contract checks → Layer 6 regression set). It is binary, reproducible, and ungameable.
2. **If — and only if — the deterministic gate is green, run the rubric judge** (Layer 2). The judge scores *quality and nuance* (clarity, completeness, design fidelity) that a test cannot capture.
3. **The judge is advisory; the gate is authoritative.** A high rubric score can never clear a red deterministic check. A model verdict may only ADD a finding (lower the quality score, surface a missed edge case), never subtract a deterministic failure. This mirrors the `launch-local-agent` grader split — an objective gate (binary, blocking) in front of a judged rubric (advisory) — and the Hermes no-leak grader stance that a model score is never sufficient alone.

This is why FCR (§2.1) is anchored to the deterministic layer, not to the judge: if a quality rubric could mark a run "done," a confident-but-wrong agent would game it. By construction, the only thing that closes `success_criteria` is layer-1/layer-6 evidence.

Order of operations per iteration: `verify-fast` (seconds, every change) → on green, the rest of `verify-full` + regression set → on green, the rubric judge → write the verification bundle → update FCR/RP → decide terminal vs repair vs continue.

---

## 4. Judge calibration

A rubric judge (Layer 2) is itself a model under test. An uncalibrated judge silently rots the whole suite, so it is governed by Layer 3:

- **Maintain a human-labeled adjudication set** in `EVALS/dataset/` — a fixed sample of artifacts with ground-truth human verdicts (accept / reject + the correct per-dimension scores). This set is the judge's "test suite."
- **Track judge↔human agreement** on that set, plus **false-accept** (judge passed what a human rejects — the dangerous direction) and **false-reject** rates. These are the key metrics of Layer 3.
- **Re-measure on a cadence and on every trigger:** monthly at minimum, AND immediately after any change that could shift judge behavior — a base-model upgrade (Opus/Sonnet version bump), a rubric edit, or a prompt-template change. Model and rubric changes both invalidate prior calibration; treat an un-recalibrated judge after a model bump as unverified.
- **The judge gates itself, not the run.** If agreement drops below threshold or false-accept rises, the judge is the thing that fails — `loop-flywheel` opens a harness-change proposal to fix the rubric or re-anchor the judge before its verdicts are trusted again. A drifted judge does not get to fail-or-pass live runs.
- **Calibration is the false-accept guard.** False-accept is the judge-level analogue of false-completion: a judge that waves through bad artifacts is a judge manufacturing false completions one level up. Weight the calibration threshold toward catching false-accepts.

The dispatched judge always names an explicit model (`reason → sonnet`); see the regression-harness example in §5.

---

## 5. The regression harness is repo-native

The regression layer (Layer 6) and the entire eval apparatus live **inside the loop's own repo**, never inside a vendor's eval product:

- **Datasets** (`EVALS/dataset/`), **rubrics** (`EVALS/rubrics/`), **regression cases** (`EVALS/regressions/`), and **trace-transform scripts** (`scripts/extract-trace-metrics`) are all committed files. Model calls are used as *grading components* invoked by repo scripts — they are not the system of record.
- **Why repo-native:** the harness must be reproducible offline, diffable in PRs, runnable in CI with no network dependency on a third-party UI, and durable against vendor churn (consumer eval platforms move fast and go read-only). A vendor eval UI that disappears takes the loop's quality history with it; a committed `EVALS/` tree does not.
- **Cases come from two sources:** (1) a hand-curated seed dataset of known-good / known-bad inputs, and (2) **trace-derived cases** — every real failure mined from `RUNLOG.md` / `.loop/receipts/*.jsonl` by [[loop-flywheel]] becomes a permanent regression case so the same failure can never silently return. Regression failure count must be **0** once a scorecard is frozen (§6); a non-zero count blocks.

**Reuse, do not reimplement.** The deterministic layer (1) *is* the contract's own `scripts/verify-fast`→`verify-full` gate. `loop-evals` **designs** the criteria and the `EVALS/` tree; `loop-run` **calls** the gate. *Optional integration:* with `claude-code-orchestration` installed, `/verify-slice` (2-iteration fix loop + Codex cross-review + escalate-to-flag) and `/verify-milestone` (Workflow batch) run that gate with auto-repair. No new verification engine is built.

A regression batch over many cases is the canonical Workflow fan-out — every dispatched grader names an explicit model:

```js
// Workflow: grade the regression set; deterministic gate per case, then a judge.
for (const c of regressionCases) {
  const det = await agent({ model: "haiku",                       // read/run: deterministic verify
    prompt: `Run scripts/verify-full against case ${c.id}; report pass/fail + constraint violations only.` });
  if (det.passed) {
    await agent({ model: "sonnet",                                // reason: rubric judgment, advisory
      prompt: `Score case ${c.id} against EVALS/rubrics/quality.md (fixed schema). Cannot override the deterministic pass.` });
  }
}
```

(`read → haiku`, `reason → sonnet`, `write → opus` per the model-routing rule; the receipts each dispatch appends land in `.loop/receipts/`.)

---

## 6. The flywheel schedule

Standing up the suite is staged — you do not freeze a scorecard on day one. [[loop-flywheel]] drives these phases; this is the order in which the eval layers come online:

1. **Baseline.** Wire Layer 1 (deterministic gate = the contract's `scripts/verify-fast`→`verify-full` against `SPEC.md` acceptance criteria; *optionally* `/verify-slice`) and Layer 7 (cost/latency from receipts). Get a first honest read: pass rate, cost-per-success, and a starting FCR. Do not optimize yet — just measure. This is the minimum a loop needs before `loop-run` is allowed to execute it.
2. **Loop-hardening.** Bring up Layer 4 (trace analysis) and Layer 2 (rubric judge), then add Layer 3 calibration. Now FCR and RP are live; tighten the loop until FCR → 0 and RP trends up. Fix the stopping rule and the repair cap here, where the behavior metrics expose thrash.
3. **Regression-harness.** Mine accumulated failures (from phases 1–2 traces) into `EVALS/regressions/`, seed the curated dataset, and bring Layer 6 online. From here, every new real failure becomes a permanent case (§5). Add Layer 5 red-team / injection probes for any loop with side-effects.
4. **Freeze the first scorecard.** Snapshot the current metric set — pass rate, FCR, RP, regression count (0), judge agreement, cost-per-success — as the **baseline scorecard**. After the freeze, Layer 6 is blocking: any regression failure or FCR > 0 fails the loop. The scorecard is what every subsequent change is measured against; [[loop-flywheel]] re-runs it on a cadence and on every harness or model change, and only proposes a new freeze when a change is a verified, broad improvement.

The schedule is a ratchet: you only add gates, and you only freeze once the cheaper layers are clean. Freezing early locks in noise; freezing late lets regressions slip. Phase 4 is the line after which "the loop got worse" becomes a hard, automatic failure rather than a thing someone has to notice.

## 7. Comparative A/B Protocol

The metrics above (§2) score *one* loop. To answer "is loop-engineer's harness actually better than a baseline reference harness?" you run the **same task set under both harnesses** and read the **swing** between their scorecards. This is a measurement protocol, not a shipped result — `scripts/benchmark_harness.py` is the measurement tool; the numbers are the operator's to run.

**The honest caveat, up front.** Any A/B number this protocol produces is **operator-run on the operator's task set with the operator's harnesses** — it is *not* a benchmark claim shipped by `loop-engineer`. The suite ships the *tool and the protocol*; it deliberately bakes in no win/loss numbers, because a comparative result is only as honest as the task set and the two harnesses behind it. Do not quote a delta from this harness as a product claim; quote it as "on *my* N tasks, *my* two harnesses swung X."

### Same task set, both harnesses

1. **Fix the task set.** Pick a fixed set of N tasks (ideally the curated seed dataset from §5 plus trace-derived cases). The *identical* set must run under both harnesses — a different task set per harness makes the swing meaningless.
2. **Run harness A (reference).** Run the baseline / reference harness over the task set. For each task, capture an outcome record (schema below).
3. **Run harness B (loop-engineer).** Run the loop-engineer harness over the *same* task set, capturing the same record per task.
4. **Hold everything else constant.** Same tasks, same success criteria, same deterministic verify layer (§3). The only independent variable is the harness.

### Capturing outcomes

Each harness run is a JSON list of per-task outcome dicts. Capture these straight from the deterministic evidence (§3) and the repair records (§2.2) — never from the agent's narration:

```json
{
  "task": "t1",
  "claimed_done": true,            // the loop self-asserted done (from RUNLOG)
  "verification_passed": true,     // layer-1/6 deterministic verify agreed
  "repairs": 2,                    // repair passes attempted
  "productive_repairs": 1,         // passes where verification_after > before
  "criteria_met": 2,               // success_criteria satisfied
  "criteria_total": 3              // success_criteria declared
}
```

- `claimed_done` × `verification_passed` is exactly the FCR cross-join of §2.1 — a `claimed_done: true` with `verification_passed: false` is a false completion.
- `productive_repairs` / `repairs` is the RP ratio of §2.2, read off the repair-record `verification_before` vs `verification_after` fields.
- `criteria_met` / `criteria_total` is the criteria-met rate.

### Reading the swing

Feed the two outcome lists to the harness:

```bash
python3 scripts/benchmark_harness.py reference.json loop_engineer.json
```

It emits each harness's per-metric scorecard plus a `delta` block — the **swing** (`loop_engineer − reference`) for each metric:

| Metric | A healthy swing for loop-engineer | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `false_completion_rate` | **negative** (lower FCR) | the deterministic-first stopping rule (§3) should declare "done" wrongly *less* often |
| `repair_productivity` | **positive** (higher RP) | bounded patch-and-repair should churn *less*, converge *more* |
| `criteria_met_rate` | **positive** (more criteria met) | more `success_criteria` actually satisfied |

Read the swing *directionally first*, magnitude second: the sign tells you whether the harness helped; a single run's magnitude is noisy. Re-run across several task sets before trusting a number, and note the N — a swing over 4 tasks is an anecdote, not a benchmark.

### What this protocol is NOT

- It is **not** a live model-vs-model bake-off. The independent variable is the *harness*, not the base model — hold the model constant across A and B.
- It is **not** a shipped claim. `loop-engineer` ships `benchmark_harness.py` + this protocol; the swing you measure is yours, run on your tasks, reportable only as such.
- It does **not** gate anything. Like the rubric judge (§3), it is advisory measurement — a model or a comparative number may only *add* a finding, never clear a deterministic failure.
