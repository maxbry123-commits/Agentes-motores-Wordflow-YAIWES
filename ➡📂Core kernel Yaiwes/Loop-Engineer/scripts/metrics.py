"""Derive false-completion-rate (FCR) and repair-productivity (RP) from a loop.

The runnable core of ST1: point it at a loop dir and it computes the two
first-class metrics (`reference/eval-suite.md` §2) from that loop's *real* on-disk
evidence — RUNLOG success claims, deterministic verify bundles, the held-out gate
verdict, the canonical repair records, and receipts — never from the agent's
narration. Every headline number ships with a `provenance` block so a skeptic can
re-derive it by hand.

Two honesty invariants distinguish this from a self-report:

  * **`productive` is recomputed, never trusted.** RP is aggregated only over
    repair records whose stored `productive` agrees with the value recomputed from
    `verification_before`/`verification_after.score` (`recheck_productive`). A
    record that disagrees, or cannot demonstrate a score delta, is *rejected* and
    excluded — reported under `provenance.rejected_records`, not silently coerced.
  * **FCR is derived two ways and disagreement is surfaced.** (a) the RUNLOG
    success-claim × verify-bundle cross-join (the deterministic anchor, per §3),
    and (b) the aggregated held-out-gate `false_completion` flag. An unmatched
    success-claim counts as a false completion (fail-closed, §8). Claim
    cleanness is outcome-class aware: a COMPLETION-class claim (`task_passed`,
    `terminal`, `succeeded`, or the terminal state itself) is clean only if
    EVERY verify bundle attached to its iteration is green — no exception of
    any kind ("not backed by a green verify … is a false completion, full
    stop"); a PROGRESS-class claim (`advanced`) may carry a red bundle only if
    that bundle's own task reaches green in a STRICTLY LATER iteration (an
    honestly-repaired intermediate). An unrelated green bundle never launders a
    red gate, and a same-iteration green never excuses its own task's red —
    within-iteration chronology is unknowable, so it fails closed.

A verify bundle whose `verifier.source` is `injected_callable` is a caller's
self-report, not an independently-executed gate, so it is excluded from every
metric before FCR and RP are derived; the excluded filenames are listed under
`provenance.injected_verifier_bundles` so the exclusion is visible rather than a
silent FCR shift. A bundle carrying no `verifier` block at all has an unknown
source and still counts — grandfathering by absence, not by guess.

The `### Outcome` token contract: a claim counts toward the FCR denominator only
when its outcome token is a recognized SUCCESS token — completion-class
(`task_passed`, `terminal`, `succeeded`) or progress-class (`advanced`);
`repair_triggered` / `task_failed` and peers are honest reds. Any other token of
two or more characters is surfaced under `provenance.unrecognized_outcomes` so a
synonym (`shipped`, `done`, `ok`, …) is visible rather than silently escaping the
denominator — it never widens the recognized-success set on its own.

A committed held-out verdict is validated structurally (it must carry the per-check
`visible`/`holdout` arrays and internally-consistent flags a real `holdout_gate`
run emits, not a hand-set 4-field stub) and its sha256 is recorded in provenance.
That committed verdict is *evidence, not proof*: a fully-fabricated,
internally-consistent artifact defeats offline shape-checking by construction, so
tamper detection of the artifact itself belongs to the anti-cheat layer
(`anticheat_scan.py`) — this command does not, and does not claim to, make the
verdict tamper-proof.

`--baseline` writes a checked-in scorecard, but only over a genuinely gate-backed
run: it refuses (non-zero, writes nothing) if no structurally-valid held-out
verdict artifact exists in the loop (plain-mode `evidence_backed` via a gate line
in a verify script is a weaker heuristic and NEVER qualifies a published
baseline), if any record was rejected, if the two FCR methods disagree, if no
iteration claims success (a vacuous 0/0 is not a publishable 0.0), or if any
counted repair record is unanchored. Baselining a self-asserted run would itself
be a false completion of ST1.

Pure stdlib, offline, deterministic: the same loop dir yields a byte-identical
scorecard.
