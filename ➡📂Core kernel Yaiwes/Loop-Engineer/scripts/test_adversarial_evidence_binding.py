"""What chain-bound evidence catches, and what it provably does not.

The claim this file defends is "evidence whose bytes are bound into an ANCHORABLE
chain", never "tamper-proof evidence". Binding inherits Slice 1's trust model
exactly: a worker who can rewrite .loop/ can rewrite the store (repo-os-contract
#16, Integrity boundary), so without an external anchor a full rewrite verifies.

Every ``*_pinned`` test states an honest limitation and carries the positive control
that bounds it: a pin whose detector was never shown to fire certifies a hole as
closed. The rest prove a real detection.
