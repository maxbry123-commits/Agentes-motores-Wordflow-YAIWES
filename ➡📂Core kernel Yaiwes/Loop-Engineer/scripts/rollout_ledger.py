"""Append-only JSONL rollout / candidate ledger (G8, schema loop-engineer/rollout@1).

A rollout/hardening loop produces a stream of *candidates*: each is a proposed
change (a harden, a config mutation, a rollout adjudication) that the loop scored
and adjudicated against the prior winner. This ledger is where that stream lands —
one JSON object per line, appended and never rewritten, so the lineage survives
compaction and session loss.

**This is the rollout / candidate ledger record, NOT the repair record.** The
canonical repair record (``schemas/repair-record.schema.json``,
``loop-engineer/repair@1``, on disk at ``.loop/repair/<iteration_id>.json``) is
what repair-productivity (RP) is derived from — see ``reference/eval-suite.md``
§2.2. This record's ``productive`` is the separate *rollout*-productivity signal
(a flywheel view of candidate adjudication), not the RP baseline.

Each record carries EXACTLY these 7 fields:

  * ``id``                          — the candidate's id.
  * ``parent``                      — parent candidate id, or ``None`` for a root.
  * ``verdict``                     — the loop's adjudication of this candidate.
  * ``score``                       — the candidate's measured score (or ``None``).
  * ``score_delta``                 — score vs the parent / prior winner.
  * ``coherent_with_prior_winner``  — does it preserve the prior winner's gains?
  * ``productive``                  — did it *measurably* improve the score?

``productive`` is never trusted verbatim (M3/HI5): ``summarize`` recomputes it
from ``score_delta`` via the shared ``recheck_productive`` validator and
**rejects** any record whose stored flag disagrees, so the productive fraction is
a derivation, not a self-report.

This ships as composable tooling, not a runtime: a loop calls ``append`` at each
adjudication and ``summarize`` when it wants the rollout-productivity readout.

Run::

    python3 rollout_ledger.py <ledger.jsonl>

Prints the summary as JSON.
