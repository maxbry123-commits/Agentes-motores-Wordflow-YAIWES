/**
 * SandboxClient implementation backed by direct capnweb RPC calls.
 *
 * The server exposes each domain (commands, files, processes, etc.) as a
 * nested RpcTarget. capnweb returns typed stubs for these so the client
 * can use `rpc.commands`, `rpc.files`, etc. directly without any
 * per-method boilerplate.
 *
 * Manages its own connection lifecycle: creates a fresh ContainerControlConnection
 * on demand and disconnects it after a configurable idle period. Idle
 * detection uses capnweb's `RpcSession.getStats()` which naturally tracks
 * all in-flight RPC calls, streams, and peer-held references — no manual
 * operation counting required.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * How capnweb tracks in-flight work (and why we poll getStats)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Every capnweb session maintains two tables: `imports` (references the
 * peer is exposing to us) and `exports` (references we are exposing to the
 * peer). `getStats()` returns the live count of each.
 *
 * At rest, both contain exactly one entry — the bootstrap "main" stub each
 * side exposes to reach the other. We treat `imports <= 1 && exports <= 1`
 * as the idle baseline.
 *
 * Each kind of in-flight work bumps these counts:
 *
 *   - **Pending RPC call.** `sendCall()` allocates a new import slot for
 *     the return value; the slot is released when the response arrives and
 *     the caller disposes the promise. So a regular call shows up as
 *     `imports = 2` for its lifetime.
 *
 *   - **Returned ReadableStream.** When the peer (the container) returns a
 *     `ReadableStream` from an RPC method (e.g. `commands.executeStream`),
 *     capnweb serializes it via `createPipe()`: the *server* allocates an
 *     import slot, pumps `readable.pipeTo(writable)` over the wire, and
 *     only releases the slot in `pipeTo().finally(() => hook.dispose())`
 *     once the source stream ends or is canceled. On *our* side this
 *     materializes as an export entry held for the same duration. So an
 *     active stream return keeps `exports = 2` even after the RPC promise
 *     that delivered the stream has already resolved.
 *
 *   - **Stubs / RpcTargets passed across the wire.** Anything the peer
 *     hands us (or we hand the peer) that isn't a plain value adds an
 *     entry until both sides dispose it.
 *
 * The practical consequence for sleepAfter: the per-call promise lifecycle
 * is *not* a reliable signal of "the container is done with this work".
 * `commands.executeStream(...)` resolves in milliseconds with a stream
 * reference, but the container then writes to that stream for seconds. The
 * only signal that survives across the promise boundary is the export
 * entry — i.e. `getStats()`.
 *
 * So the strategy is:
 *
 *   1. Run a periodic poll while the WebSocket is connected.
 *   2. While `imports > 1 || exports > 1`, treat the session as busy:
 *      hold the DO's `inflightRequests` counter at >= 1 and renew the
 *      activity timeout each tick so the sleepAfter alarm gets pushed
 *      forward.
 *   3. When the poll observes idle, decrement back to 0, renew once more
 *      to reset the inactivity window from now, and schedule the WS
 *      disconnect.
 *
 * On top of that, every RPC method invocation also fires `onActivity`
 * synchronously at call start. That keeps fast calls from racing the
 * poll cadence: even if a call begins and ends entirely between two
 * polls, the activity timeout was renewed at the start.
