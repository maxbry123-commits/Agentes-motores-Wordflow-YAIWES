# ── Test DB isolation (must run at conftest import, before any gitd import) ───
# gitd.models.base builds its SQLAlchemy engine bound to settings.db_path AT
# IMPORT TIME, and `settings` is created the first time gitd.config is imported.
# So the ONLY place we can redirect the DB is here, at conftest import — pytest
# loads conftest before collecting/importing any test module that pulls in gitd.
# Without this, trace tests (which insert and DELETE trace rows) run against the
# real data/gitd.db and wipe live rows. This module does NOT import gitd, so the
# env var is set first.
# ── iOS feature gate ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# iOS support ships gate-OFF by default; the test suite exercises the full iOS
# surface, so enable it here. Gate-off behavior has its own dedicated tests
