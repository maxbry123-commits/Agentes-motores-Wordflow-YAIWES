# Job Scheduler — Feature Summary

## What It Does

Per-phone job queue with priority-based scheduling, preemption, timeout enforcement, and orphan recovery. Runs as a daemon thread inside the Flask server, ticking every 30 seconds to enqueue due scheduled jobs, launch pending work, and detect finished processes. All automation jobs (post, skill execution, app exploration) flow through this single scheduler.

## Current State

**Working:**
- 30-second scheduler tick loop (daemon thread)
- Per-phone job queues (one active job per device at a time)
- Priority-based preemption with 90-second grace period
- 6 job types supported
- Platform guards for `ios:<udid>` devices
- Orphan detection and recovery (dead PIDs, server restart)
- Timeout enforcement with SIGTERM → SIGKILL escalation
- 24h timeline visualization in dashboard Scheduler tab
- Full job CRUD via REST API
- Log file capture per job (`/tmp/sched_job_<id>.log`)
- Job summary parsing from `[done]` markers in logs
- Skill workflow result parsing from `Data: {...}` log payloads
- Manual restarts preserve platform guards and scheduled job timeouts
- Protection: never preempts post/publish_draft jobs (interrupting corrupts state)

**Limitations:**
- Single active job per phone (no parallel jobs on same device)
- No retry-on-failure logic (jobs fail once and stay failed)
- No cron-style scheduling (only interval and daily-times)
- Preemption kills the entire subprocess (no graceful pause/resume)

## Architecture

```
scheduled_jobs table (recurring configs)
    │
    │  _scheduler_tick() every 30s (daemon thread)
    ▼
Step 0: Clean orphaned running jobs (dead PIDs not in _phone_procs)
    │   Archive completed orphans, kill timed-out orphans
    ▼
Step 1: Enqueue due scheduled jobs → job_queue (status='pending')
    │   _is_job_due() checks interval/daily_times against last run
    ▼
Step 2: _process_phone_queue() per device
    │   ├─ If no running job → launch highest-priority pending
    │   ├─ If running job finished → parse log summary, archive to job_runs
    │   └─ If higher-priority pending waiting >90s → preempt current
    ▼
Step 3: Check running jobs for timeout (max_duration_s)
    │   SIGTERM → wait 5s → SIGKILL if still alive
    ▼
Step 4: Detect externally finished processes → archive

State machine per job:
  pending → running → completed|failed|timeout|killed|preempted → archived to job_runs
```

## Job Types

| Type | Script | Default Timeout | Purpose |
|------|--------|----------------|---------|
| `post` | `bots/tiktok/upload.py` | 900s | Video upload (draft/post) |
| `publish_draft` | `bots/tiktok/upload.py` | 900s | Publish existing draft |
| `skill_workflow` | `skills/_run_skill.py` | 900s | Run a skill workflow |
| `skill_action` | `skills/_run_skill.py` | 900s | Run a single skill action |
| `app_explore` | `skills/auto_creator.py` | 900s | BFS app exploration |

## iOS Scheduling

iOS schedules use the same queue and schedule tables, but `ios:<udid>` devices are limited to supported skill workflows and app exploration for now. Android TikTok jobs such as `post`, `publish_draft`, and `crawl` return `unsupported_platform` for iOS because the iOS upload/crawl flows are not ported yet.

TikTok account preflight is partially supported on iOS. The scheduler can launch
TikTok, read visible WDA text, detect the active handle, and block an observed
wrong-account run. Calling the account-switch endpoint for the already active
iOS handle returns a successful no-op; switching from one iOS TikTok account to
another still returns `unsupported_platform` until the iOS account-switcher flow
is ported.

The dashboard schedule form detects iOS devices and now defaults to the
release-quality Chrome/news workflow:

```json
{
  "skill": "safari",
  "workflow": "read_news",
  "params": {
    "url": "https://text.npr.org/",
    "max_headlines": 5,
    "max_articles": 3,
    "wait_s": 2,
    "bundle_id": "com.google.chrome.ios",
    "save_screenshots": true,
    "out_dir": "data/ios_chrome_news_smoke"
  }
}
```

The same form also exposes TikTok smoke workflows and `app_explore` for iOS:

```json
{
  "skill": "tiktok_ios",
  "workflow": "profile_smoke",
  "params": {
    "expected": "Profile",
    "wait_timeout": 8,
    "max_lines": 80
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "package": "com.google.chrome.ios",
  "max_depth": 2,
  "max_states": 8
}
```

Real iPhone execution still depends on Appium/WebDriverAgent being healthy for the target UDID.

Completed skill jobs that emit structured `Data: {...}` output can be queried
without scraping logs:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5055/api/scheduler/history/<run_id>/result | python3 -m json.tool
```

In the dashboard, click a completed Recent Runs row to open the run detail panel.
When structured output is present, the panel shows a compact result section above
the raw logs; iOS Chrome/news runs render headlines and article snippets.

## Database Tables

job_queue        -- Active queue (pending/running jobs with PID, log_file, timestamps)
job_runs         -- Archived history (completed/failed/killed with duration, exit_code, error_msg)
```

## Key Constants

| Constant | Value | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `_PREEMPT_GRACE_S` | 90 seconds | Wait this long before preempting a lower-priority job |
| Tick interval | 30 seconds | How often the scheduler checks all queues |
| Default `max_duration_s` | 900 (15min) | Per-job timeout if not overridden |

## Dashboard Integration

- **Scheduler tab:** 24h visual timeline (color-coded bars per job type), schedule CRUD form, recent runs table with filters, per-phone queue status indicators
- **Bot tab:** Quick-launch buttons for post jobs that enqueue to the same job queue
- **Skill Hub tab:** Run workflow/action buttons enqueue `skill_workflow`/`skill_action` jobs

## Known Issues & TODOs

- [ ] No retry-on-failure (a failed job stays failed — must manually re-enqueue)
- [ ] No cron-style scheduling (e.g., "every Monday at 9am")
- [ ] Preemption kills subprocess hard — no graceful pause/resume mechanism
- [ ] Log files accumulate in `/tmp/` — no automatic cleanup
- [ ] No max concurrent jobs across all phones (could overwhelm the machine)
- [ ] `_phone_procs` dict is in-memory only — lost on server restart (orphan recovery handles this but with delay)
- [ ] Job priority 1 (highest) through 5 (lowest) but only 2 is commonly used
