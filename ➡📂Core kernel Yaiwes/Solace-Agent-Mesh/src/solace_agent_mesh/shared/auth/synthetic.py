"""
Synthetic-monitor authentication path.

Allows a non-interactive caller (e.g. Datadog Synthetics) to authenticate
against the gateway by presenting an Entra ID-issued JWT minted via the
OAuth client_credentials grant. The token carries an app role and no user
identity; this module validates it locally against the tenant's JWKS and
maps it to a fixed synthetic principal.

This is config-gated. When `synthetic.enabled` is False (or the config
block is absent), no synthetic auth path exists.

Defense in depth — every check below is independently load-bearing:
- Standard JWT validation (signature, alg allowlist, iss, aud, tid, exp,
  nbf, iat with skew).
- Strict role match (token.roles must equal exactly the configured role).
- `appid`/`azp` allowlist of known Datadog client app GUIDs.
- No user identity claims (sub/oid/preferred_username/upn must be absent).
- Endpoint allowlist enforced before any handler runs.

The synthetic principal is hard-coded and uses a non-routable namespace
(`synthetic-monitor@synthetics.invalid`) so it can never collide with a
real user. The well-known `user_id = "synthetic-monitor"` is the agreed
identifier across the gateway and ADK session DBs.
