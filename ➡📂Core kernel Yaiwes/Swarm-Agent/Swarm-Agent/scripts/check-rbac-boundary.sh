# Enforce the RBAC authorization boundary (DES-445 slice 1).
#
# All authorization DECISIONS in API-side code must go through `can()` from
# src/rbac/ — no inline `isLead` authz conditionals in src/tools/ or src/http/.
# The Phase-1 gate inventory (plan 2026-07-07-des-445-rbac-slice1-can-audit.md,
# Appendix A) migrated every HARD gate; this check keeps them migrated and
# fails any NEW inline `isLead` authz check with a pointer to src/rbac.
#
# HONEST LIMITS of this check:
#   - It enforces "no inline isLead authz conditional", NOT "every new tool
#     calls can()". A tool added without any permission check passes silently.
#     Enforcement-by-construction (a required `permissions` field on
#     ToolConfig / route()) is increment 5 of DES-445.
#   - Lines where `isLead` appears only as an object/type PROPERTY KEY are
#     allowed wholesale (principal construction feeding can(), zod schemas,
#     createAgent registration pass-through, memory visibility pins). The
#     filter is line-granular: a conditional sharing a line with a property
#     key slips through — don't write those.
#
# Allowed `isLead` usage (everything else is a violation):
#   1. Property-key / shorthand-property lines (see above).
#   2. SOFT memory read-visibility scoping — memory RBAC parallel track:
#        src/tools/memory-search.ts
#   3. NON-AUTHZ sites (Appendix A):
#        src/tools/slack-reply.ts   — cosmetic icon_emoji pick
#        src/tools/get-swarm.ts     — cosmetic ", lead" tag in the agent-list
#                                     details rendering
#        src/tools/join-swarm.ts    — registration-time lead assignment
#                                     (increment-4 hardening surface)
#        src/tools/send-task.ts     — target-shape guard (task TO lead)
#        src/http/poll.ts           — lead-vs-worker trigger routing
#   4. Principal-construction plumbing:
#        src/http/kv.ts             — buildAuthCtx isLead local feeding can()
