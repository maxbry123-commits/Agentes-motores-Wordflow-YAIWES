 * is bounded, deterministic, and survives worker-container restarts — the
 * failure modes that native resume could not handle.
 *
 * `resolveResumeSession` is preserved as an observability shim: it accepts
 * the same candidate shape the runner already builds and returns every
 * non-empty candidate in `skipped` with a deprecation reason. The result's
 * `resumeSessionId` is always `undefined` — adapters spawn fresh sessions.
