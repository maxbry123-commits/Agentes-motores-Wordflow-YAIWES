 * so the caller can `failTask(parent.id, 'superseded_workflow_task')` and let
 * the workflow engine's retry/failure policy take over.
 *
 * Field inheritance is transitive via `createTaskExtended`'s `parentTaskId`
 * lookup (`dir`, `vcsRepo`/`vcsProvider`/etc., `outputSchema`, Slack/AgentMail
 * context, `requestedByUserId`, `contextKey`, `followUpConfig`). This was chosen
 * over re-listing fields here so there is a single source of truth.
 *
 * `model` is intentionally NOT inherited: a resume task is routinely claimed by
 * a different worker (and thus a different harness/provider) than the parent, so
 * carrying the parent's concrete provider-specific model would break the child
 * at session-init. The resume task runs on the assignee agent's own model. See
 * the `model` carve-out comment in `createTaskExtended` (`src/be/db.ts`).
 *
 * Routing: the parent's assigned worker (`parent.agentId`) is preferred when
 * the agent row still exists, is not `offline`, and has remaining capacity
 * (`getActiveTaskCount < agent.maxTasks`). For `crash_recovery` the pin holds
 * regardless of `lastActivityAt` freshness — the agent ID is stable across a
 * restart and the crashed row survives intact, so a stale `lastActivityAt` at
 * the ~5-min crash-detection mark means "restarting", not "gone". `graceful_shutdown`
 * follows the same pin path when `HEARTBEAT_PIN_GRACEFUL_RESUME` is enabled:
 * deploy/SIGTERM restarts preserve the stable agent ID and the stale-pin reaper
 * now handles the "agent never returns" case. Pinning keeps the resume off the
 * role-blind unassigned pool so no wrong-specialization worker can grab it
 * (DES-523). For `context_limits` / `manual_supersede` the worker is alive, so
 * `lastActivityAt` freshness is still required. The resume falls back to the
 * unassigned pool only when the agent is genuinely gone (graceful close →
 * `offline`) or its row is absent.
 *
 * Gone-agent / never-reclaimed case: a pin whose agent never returns is NOT
 * re-pooled — the heartbeat's stale-resume reaper (`escalateUnreclaimedResumes`
 * in `src/heartbeat/heartbeat.ts`) escalates it to a Lead re-delegation decision
 * once `HEARTBEAT_RESUME_PIN_GRACE_MIN` lapses.
 *
 * The crash pin is gated by `HEARTBEAT_PIN_CRASH_RESUME`; the graceful shutdown
 * pin is gated by `HEARTBEAT_PIN_GRACEFUL_RESUME`. Both default on.
