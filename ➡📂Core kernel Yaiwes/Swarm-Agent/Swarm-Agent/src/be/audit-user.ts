/**
 * Resolve the trusted audit-actor user id for a write to an audited table
 * (`scripts` / `workflows` / `scheduled_tasks`).
 *
 * Audit attribution MUST NOT be spoofable by a client-supplied header. The
 * `X-Source-Task-Id` header names the task on whose behalf a write happens, but
 * on its own a caller could name ANY task id and inherit that task's requester
 * as the audit actor. We close that hole by only trusting the source task when
 * it is actually assigned to the calling agent: a caller can then only ever
 * attribute a write to a task they already own, whose requester is legitimately
 * theirs.
 *
 * Two fallbacks layer on top of the header, both still gated by ownership:
 *   1. No header at all → the caller's own current in-progress task (never a
 *      client-supplied id, so this can't be spoofed).
 *   2. The resolved task has no `requestedByUserId` but carries a
 *      machine-recorded provider external id (today: the Slack user field) →
 *      the same generic reverse lookup used everywhere else.
 *
 * Returns `null` when no trusted actor can be established — which leaves the
 * audit column untouched on updates and NULL on inserts.
