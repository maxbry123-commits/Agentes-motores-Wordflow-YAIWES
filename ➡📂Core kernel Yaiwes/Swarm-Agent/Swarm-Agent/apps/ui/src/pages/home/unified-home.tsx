/**
 * Unified Home — the `/` landing page. This is the only home surface; there is
 * no `/old-home` or `/old-dashboard`. To change what `/` shows, change this file.
 *
 * A welcome heading above the full swarm `AgentActivityTimeline`. The timeline
 * fetches its own data and owns its loading/error/empty states, and fills the
 * height it is given, so this page contributes only the header and padding.
 *
 * The `flex-1 min-h-0` chain from the root down to the timeline slot is
 * load-bearing: break it and the timeline's `h-full` resolves against an auto
 * height and collapses.
 *
 * The timeline is feature-gated on API ≥1.76.0. The gate is evaluated against
 * the *resolved* version: while the version query is pending we render a
 * skeleton, never the "requires 1.76+" notice — that only shows on a confirmed
 * unsupported version.
