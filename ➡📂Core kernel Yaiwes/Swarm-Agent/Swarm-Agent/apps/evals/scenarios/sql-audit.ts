/**
 * sql-audit (v8.0 round-11, Data, 1 worker)
 * ------------------------------------------
 * Calibrated spread: TODO(calibration) — fill frontierAvg / budgetAvg / gap from
 * the round-11 sweep (anchors: claude-opus-4.8, codex-5.6-sol vs pi-deepseek-flash,
 * claude-haiku). Ship gate: frontierAvg − budgetAvg ≥ 0.2. Target ~0.4 → 0.9.
 *
 * The API DB is pre-seeded from `sql-audit-history.sql` — a full dev-DB dump
 * carrying 30 historical `agent_tasks` rows across `completed`/`failed`/
 * `cancelled` statuses with red herrings. The worker AUDITS that history through
 * the swarm API and answers three graded questions, writing each answer to its
 * own file. Grading:
 *   - `correctness` (weight 3): three answer-key `fileContains` checks —
 *       Q1 count of completed tasks, Q2 the highest-priority completed task's
 *       title, Q3 the one status/output-contradiction anomaly.
 *   - `communication` (weight 1): a judge grades the written audit report's
 *       clarity and whether it justifies each answer from the data.
 *
 * Anti-gaming (checklist applied to THIS scenario):
 *   - Red-herring rows (failed/cancelled, plus near-miss priorities 92/88/85)
 *     make the count and the "which" non-trivial — naive "count all" or
 *     "pick the one named deploy" both score 0.
 *   - The anomaly (a `failed` task whose `output` claims success) is NOT
 *     derivable from any single field or from the prompt — only a cross-
 *     reference of status against output surfaces it.
 *   - The answer-key VALUES (21, "Rotate the payments service API keys", the
 *     checkout-redesign anomaly) appear NOWHERE in the task text, so echoing
 *     the prompt or guessing scores 0 on the per-question checks.
 *   - The grading rubric / check patterns are NOT shown to the worker.
 *
 * Answer key (mirror of `generate-sql-audit-history.ts` output — regenerate the
 * fixture and update both if the dataset changes):
 *   Q1 completed count                  = 21
 *   Q2 highest-priority completed title = "Rotate the payments service API keys"
 *   Q3 anomaly title                    = "Deploy the checkout redesign to production"
