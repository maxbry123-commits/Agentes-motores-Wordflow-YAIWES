/**
 * bug-ladder (v8.0 round-11, Code, 1 worker, budgetUsd: 1.5)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------
 * Calibrated spread: TODO(calibration) — fill frontierAvg / budgetAvg / gap from
 * the round-11 sweep (anchors: claude-opus-4.8, codex-5.6-sol vs pi-deepseek-flash,
 * claude-haiku). Ship gate: frontierAvg − budgetAvg ≥ 0.2. Target ~0.35 → 0.9.
 *
 * Round-11 hardening: the original five-bug ladder SATURATED — budget models tied
 * frontier at correctness 1.00 — so two MORE subtle bugs (a slug
 * collapse/edge-trim bug and a greedy word-wrap with an off-by-one + dropped
 * over-long word) were added as test groups bug6/bug7. They are the kind of
 * edge-case/logic flaw a weaker model ships a plausible-but-wrong first pass for,
 * so correctness becomes a graded fraction over SEVEN groups that separates models
 * (frontier clears ~all; budget reliably leaves bug6/bug7 — and often bug4/bug5 —
 * red). Correctness (weight 3) is the real discriminator here.
 *
 * Also exercises the deterministic `efficiency` dimension (v8.0 §5). NOTE the
 * budget is a WASTE-GUARD, not a quality lever — see the budgetUsd comment below.
 *
 * A seeded bun project at /workspace/ladder/ ships a single source module
 * (`src/textkit.ts`) with SEVEN planted bugs of graded difficulty — typo →
 * off-by-one → logic → edge case → subtle Unicode → slug collapse/trim → greedy
 * word-wrap — and SEVEN independent test files (`test/bug1..bug7.test.ts`), one
 * per bug, each its own graded test group. A single worker fixes the
 * implementation (never the tests) until each group is green. Reuses the
 * `seed.exec` heredoc test-suite machinery + `dependsOn` + per-test-group green
 * checks from the old `build-verify-fix` scenario, generalized to a GRADED ladder
 * so a config that fixes 5 of 7 bugs ranks above one that fixes 3
 * (`testGroupsGreen` → score = green/total).
 *
 * Grading:
 *   - `correctness` (weight 3): the FRACTION of the seven per-bug test groups
 *       that pass — graded via `testGroupsGreen` (partial credit). Each group is
 *       `bun test test/bugN.test.ts`; exit 0 == green.
 *   - `instruction-following` (weight 1): a deterministic check that the seven
 *       SEEDED test files are byte-for-byte UNMODIFIED (the worker was told to
 *       fix the implementation, never the tests) AND that no stray dependency was
 *       added (no node_modules/package install beyond the seeded bun project) —
 *       so a config can't "win" correctness by weakening or deleting the tests.
 *   - `efficiency` (weight 1, deterministic — v8.0 §5): scored from the attempt's
 *       REAL cost vs the $1.5 budget as a WASTE-GUARD only. Unpriced attempts
 *       re-normalize this dimension OUT (never scored 0).
 *
 * Anti-gaming (checklist applied to THIS scenario):
 *   - The tests-UNMODIFIED instruction-following check (weight 1) is the guard
 *     against tampering: a config that edits, weakens, deletes, or `skip`s a test
 *     file to make `bun test` exit 0 scores proportionally on instruction-
 *     following (the check compares each test file byte-for-byte to its seeded
 *     content, so any tamper is caught). Note the correctness groups run the
 *     ON-DISK test files, NOT a pristine copy — so a config that weakens a test
 *     still scores full correctness on the gutted on-disk test; it is the separate
 *     instruction-following dimension that penalizes the tamper.
 *   - The CORRECT implementation of each bug is NOT derivable from the task
 *     prompt — the prompt names no function, no expected value, and no fix. The
 *     only source of truth is running the seeded tests and reading their failing
 *     assertions; ground truth lives in the seeded `test/` bodies, never in the
 *     task text.
 *   - Grading is by TEST EXECUTION (exit code), not self-report — a worker can't
 *     claim green; the harness re-runs each group against the real sandbox.
 *   - The grading rubric / per-group thresholds are NOT shown to the worker.
 *   - The bugs span difficulty so the score is continuous: the typo is trivially
 *     fixable (budget configs clear it), while the subtle Unicode/grapheme bug,
 *     the off-by-one truncation edge, the slug separator-run/edge-trim bug, and the
 *     word-wrap off-by-one/dropped-word edge separate frontier from budget.
