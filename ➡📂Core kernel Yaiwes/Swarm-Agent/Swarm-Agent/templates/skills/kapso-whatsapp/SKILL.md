description: How to interact with Kapso WhatsApp from the swarm — read inbound webhook payloads (text AND media), fetch message history, send free-form messages within the 24h session window (and template messages outside it), mark-as-read, show the typing indicator, send reactions, download media, verify webhook signatures, and resolve contacts to swarm users. Canonical reference for ANY Kapso interaction beyond the thin `send-whatsapp-message` / `reply-whatsapp-message` MCP tools — for templates, media, reactions, typing, mark-as-read, signature verify, contact resolution, conversation history, drop to the REST recipes here. Use whenever a task references a WhatsApp message routed through Kapso, or when a workflow needs to reply on WhatsApp.

# Kapso WhatsApp

Kapso (https://kapso.ai) is a WhatsApp platform vendor that fronts the Meta Cloud API. A swarm provisions one or more WhatsApp phone numbers and wires each one to either the native inbound handler or a workflow that dispatches a task per inbound message.

## When to use MCP tools vs this skill's REST recipes

The integration ships **thin MCP-tool wrappers for the common case only**:

| Tool | Use for |
|---|---|
| `send-whatsapp-message` | Free-form text within the 24h session window. |
| `reply-whatsapp-message` | Same as above but quote-threads to an inbound WAMID. |
| `register-kapso-number` / `unregister-kapso-number` | Provisioning a phone number's webhook + KV mapping. |

**For ANYTHING else, drop to the REST recipes in this skill** — these are the canonical reference, and the MCP tools deliberately do NOT duplicate them:

- **Template messages** (outside 24h window) → §"Send a template" below.
- **Media** (image / document / audio / video, including wide-image padding and PTT voice notes) → §"Sending media".
- **Reactions** (👀 / ✅ / clear) → §"Send a reaction".
- **Typing indicator + mark-as-read** → §"Mark as read + typing indicator".
- **Signature verify (manual)** → §"Webhook signature verification".
- **Contact resolution → swarm user** → §"Resolve a contact to a swarm user".
- **Conversation history / message detail / templates list** → §"Read conversation context".

If the MCP-tool send returns a 24h-window error (`sessionWindowExpired: true`), fall through to the template path in §"Send a template" — this is exactly what the tool's structured-error points at.

## Setup

Swarm config keys (resolve with `get-config key:<NAME> includeSecrets:true` — Lead-only for secrets; workers should ask Lead if they need a value injected):

| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| `KAPSO_API_BASE_URL` | `https://api.kapso.ai` (host only, no `/platform/v1`) |
| `KAPSO_API_KEY` | API key (`X-API-Key` header) |
| `KAPSO_PHONE_NUMBER_ID` | The swarm's provisioned number's Meta phone-number ID |
| `KAPSO_WEBHOOK_HMAC_SECRET` | Shared HMAC secret. Kapso signs every webhook request with `X-Webhook-Signature: <hex>` |

The curl recipes below assume `$API_BASE`, `$API_KEY`, and `$PHONE_NUMBER_ID` are set in your shell. `get-config` is an MCP tool, not a shell command — call it as a tool first, then export the values it returns:

```bash
# Values from the `get-config` MCP tool (key:<NAME> includeSecrets:true):
API_BASE=https://api.kapso.ai        # KAPSO_API_BASE_URL
API_KEY=<value of KAPSO_API_KEY>
PHONE_NUMBER_ID=<value of KAPSO_PHONE_NUMBER_ID>
```

The Kapso CLI is NOT installed in worker containers. Use direct HTTP or clone the `gokapso/agent-skills` repo for fallback scripts.

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/gokapso/agent-skills /tmp/kapso-skills
cd /tmp/kapso-skills/skills/integrate-whatsapp && npm i  # or observe-whatsapp / automate-whatsapp
```

The Meta Cloud API is proxied at `$API_BASE/meta/whatsapp/v24.0/...` (auth: `X-API-Key`). Kapso's own platform endpoints live at `$API_BASE/platform/v1/...`.

## Inbound webhook payload (v2)

When inbound events are routed through a workflow, the workflow's webhook trigger receives `whatsapp.message.*` and `whatsapp.conversation.*` events at `POST https://<your-swarm-host>/api/webhooks/<workflow-id>`.

Shape (top-level keys):

```json
{
  "message": {
    "id": "wamid.HBgL...",            // Meta message id (WAMID)
    "from": "15551234567",            // E.164 without + (sender)
    "from_user_id": "XX.00000...",    // Meta-internal user id
    "timestamp": "1700000000",        // unix seconds (string)
    "type": "text",                   // text | image | audio | video | document | sticker | location | contacts | reaction | ...
    "text": { "body": "hi" },         // only for type=text
    "context": null,                  // present when the user quote-replied another message
    "kapso": {
      "direction": "inbound|outbound",
      "status": "received|delivered|read|sent|failed",
      "processing_status": "pending|completed",
      "origin": "cloud_api",
      "has_media": false,
      "content": "hi"                 // text representation (caption / filename / body)
    }
  },
  "conversation": {
    "id": "<conversation-uuid>",
    "phone_number": "15551234567",
    "phone_number_id": "<PHONE_NUMBER_ID>",
    "contact_name": "Jane Doe",
    "status": "active",
    "last_active_at": "...",
    "created_at": "...",
    "kapso": {
      "messages_count": 10,
      "last_message_id": "wamid...",
      "last_message_text": "hi",
      "last_inbound_at": "...",
      "last_outbound_at": "..."
    }
  },
  "is_new_conversation": false,
  "phone_number_id": "<PHONE_NUMBER_ID>"
}
```

**ALWAYS filter on `message.kapso.direction == "inbound"`** — Kapso fires the webhook for the swarm's own outbound sends, deliveries, reads, and failures too. Only inbound events from real humans warrant a task.

Test payloads include `"test": true` and `wamid.TEST_...` ids — handle gracefully (treat as a real inbound but mark it test in your reply; do not send a real WhatsApp reply to test payloads).

## Non-text message types

`message.type` can be `text`, `image`, `audio`, `video`, `document`, `sticker`, `location`, `contacts`, `reaction`, `button`, or `interactive`. Non-text inbound messages carry a type-specific object:

| type | object | key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `image` | `message.image` | `id` (media id), `mime_type`, `sha256`, `caption?` |
| `audio` | `message.audio` | `id`, `mime_type`, `voice` (true = voice note), `sha256` |
| `video` | `message.video` | `id`, `mime_type`, `sha256`, `caption?` |
| `document` | `message.document` | `id`, `mime_type`, `filename`, `sha256`, `caption?` |
| `sticker` | `message.sticker` | `id`, `mime_type`, `animated`, `sha256` |
| `location` | `message.location` | `latitude`, `longitude`, `name?`, `address?` |
| `contacts` | `message.contacts[]` | `name`, `phones[]`, `emails[]`, ... |
| `reaction` | `message.reaction` | `message_id` (wamid being reacted to), `emoji` |

`message.kapso.has_media` is `true` for image/audio/video/document/sticker. `message.kapso.content` carries a text representation where one exists (caption, filename). `message.transcript` may be present for audio if Kapso pre-transcribed it.

### Downloading media

Media messages carry a Meta **media id** (`message.<type>.id`), not a URL. Two-step download via the Kapso proxy:

1. Resolve the media id to a temporary URL + metadata:
   ```bash
   curl -s -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
     "$API_BASE/meta/whatsapp/v24.0/<MEDIA_ID>"
   # → { "url": "https://lookaside.fbsbx.com/...", "mime_type": "...", "file_size": ..., "id": "...", "sha256": "..." }
   ```
2. Download the binary from that `url` (Meta lookaside URLs expire fast — download immediately):
   ```bash
   curl -sL -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" "<url>" -o /tmp/media.bin
   ```

NB: verify the exact proxy path against a real media message if your swarm has only handled `text` inbound so far. If the lookaside `url` 403s with `X-API-Key`, retry through `$API_BASE/meta/whatsapp/...`.

### Recommended handling per type (proposal — adapt to what your swarm has installed)

- **audio / voice notes** → download the media. If the swarm has a speech-to-text capability (e.g. ElevenLabs Scribe, Whisper, or a transcription skill/tool installed on some role), transcribe via that path and feed the transcript into the conversation as if it were a text message. If no STT capability is available, download and process the raw media, or acknowledge and ask the sender to send text. Check which role owns audio/transcription in your swarm before assuming it exists.
- **image** → download, then describe / answer with a vision-capable model if one is available. A screenshot captioned "debug this" should get a real answer, not "I can't read images".
- **document** → download; read the text content (PDF/txt/etc.) and act on it.
- **video** → acknowledge + ask for specifics unless there is a clear transcription need.
- **location** → use `latitude` / `longitude` directly.
- **sticker** → treat as a lightweight reaction; usually no substantive reply needed.
- **reaction** → a user reacting to one of the swarm's messages. Usually acknowledge silently — do NOT trigger a full reply loop. (A debounce node, where present, naturally drops reaction-only events.)
- **contacts** → extract the shared contact info; act per the conversation.

## Resolve a contact to a swarm user

The goal is to map an inbound Kapso contact (`conversation.contact_name` + `message.from` phone) to whatever user identity your swarm tracks. Two paths in order:

1. By name: `resolve-user name:"<contact_name>"` (fuzzy substring match). Returns the canonical profile if there's one. Useful for contacts already registered in the swarm's user registry.
2. If no match — the contact is unknown. Lead can run `manage-user create name:"<contact_name>" notes:"WhatsApp +<phone>"` to register them. Workers should NOT create users autonomously; ask Lead.

Always quote the phone number in `manage-user notes` so future lookups by phone work (until the user registry has a dedicated `phone` column).

## Read conversation context

Use the Kapso platform endpoints via curl (no CLI needed):

```bash
# Values from the `get-config` MCP tool, exported as in Setup above:
# API_BASE, API_KEY, PHONE_NUMBER_ID

# List conversations for the swarm's number
curl -s -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  "$API_BASE/platform/v1/whatsapp/conversations?phone_number_id=$PHONE_NUMBER_ID&status=active" | jq

# Get a single conversation
curl -s -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  "$API_BASE/platform/v1/whatsapp/conversations/<conversation_id>" | jq

# List messages for a conversation — USE THE QUERY-PARAM FORM.
# (The conversation-scoped path /conversations/<id>/messages returns 404.)
curl -s -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  "$API_BASE/platform/v1/whatsapp/messages?conversation_id=<conversation_id>&limit=20" | jq

# Single message detail
curl -s -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  "$API_BASE/platform/v1/whatsapp/messages/<wamid>" | jq
```

The message list is returned newest-first.

## Send a free-form text (within the 24h session window)

Per WhatsApp policy, free-form text is only allowed within 24h of the last inbound message. Outside that window you MUST use a pre-approved template (see "Send a template" below).

**Common case shortcut:** call the `send-whatsapp-message` MCP tool — it wraps exactly this REST call. The recipe below is the canonical reference and the fallback when you need fields the tool doesn't expose.

```bash
TO="15551234567"
TEXT="Hi 👋"

curl -s -X POST -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{
    \"messaging_product\": \"whatsapp\",
    \"recipient_type\": \"individual\",
    \"to\": \"$TO\",
    \"type\": \"text\",
    \"text\": { \"preview_url\": false, \"body\": \"$TEXT\" }
  }" \
  "$API_BASE/meta/whatsapp/v24.0/$PHONE_NUMBER_ID/messages" | jq
```

Returns `{ "messages": [{ "id": "wamid..." }] }` on success. Log the wamid.

### Quote-reply (thread to the original message)

Add a `context` object to make the message render as a reply to a specific inbound message. The `reply-whatsapp-message` MCP tool wraps exactly this; use the raw recipe when you need to combine quote-reply with media / templates / reactions (the tool only does text).

```json
{
  "messaging_product": "whatsapp",
  "recipient_type": "individual",
  "to": "<phone>",
  "context": { "message_id": "<inbound_wamid>" },
  "type": "text",
  "text": { "preview_url": false, "body": "<reply>" }
}
```

Prefer quote-replies when answering a specific question — it keeps long conversations legible.

## Sending media (image, document, audio, video)

Two-step pipeline through Kapso's Meta proxy: **upload, then send by id**. Sending by `id` is more reliable than `link` (no public-host requirement) — validated 2026-05-20.

### 1. Upload

```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  -F "messaging_product=whatsapp" \
  -F "type=<mime>" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/file.ext;type=<mime>" \
  "$API_BASE/meta/whatsapp/v24.0/$PHONE_NUMBER_ID/media"
# → {"id":"<media-id>"}
```

### 2. Send by id

```json
{ "type": "image",    "image":    { "id": "<id>", "caption": "..." } }
{ "type": "document", "document": { "id": "<id>", "filename": "name.ext", "caption": "..." } }
{ "type": "audio",    "audio":    { "id": "<id>" } }
{ "type": "video",    "video":    { "id": "<id>", "caption": "..." } }
```

Quote-reply works on media too — add `"context": { "message_id": "<wamid>" }` at the top level.

### Wide images: pad to ~square, send as image (validated 2026-05-20)

WhatsApp scales `type:image` to bubble width + recompresses, so a wide 1200×630 social card renders as a tiny shrunken strip. **The fix is NOT `type:document`** — a `.png` sent as a document shows a plain file card with NO inline preview (must tap+download). Bad UX both ways.

Correct approach: **letterbox/pad the wide image onto a ~1:1 (1080×1080) or 4:5 (1080×1350) canvas** with a solid bg fill (white, or a colour sampled from the card's corner), card centered, then send THAT as `type:image`. WhatsApp shows ~1:1–4:5 images large WITH a preview and won't shrink them.

Pad with Pillow (ImageMagick is NOT installed in workers; `pip`/`python3 -c` with PIL works):

```python
from PIL import Image
src = Image.open("in.png").convert("RGB"); w,h = src.size
bg = src.getpixel((0,0))                       # sample corner for fill
card = src.resize((1080, round(h*1080/w)), Image.LANCZOS)
canvas = Image.new("RGB", (1080,1080), bg)
canvas.paste(card, (0,(1080-card.height)//2)); canvas.save("out.png")
```

Reserve `type:document` for ACTUAL files — PDFs (which DO render a preview), spreadsheets, etc. — never for images.

### Voice notes (PTT play bar)

For PTT (play bar in the bubble), the audio MUST be `audio/ogg` with Opus. MP3 sends as a generic audio attachment, no PTT bar.
```bash
ffmpeg -i in.mp3 -c:a libopus -b:a 32k -application voip out.ogg
```

## Mark as read + typing indicator

The mark-as-read endpoint doubles as the typing indicator. POST to the same `/messages` endpoint with `status: "read"` and an optional `typing_indicator`:

```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messaging_product": "whatsapp",
    "status": "read",
    "message_id": "<inbound_wamid>",
    "typing_indicator": { "type": "text" }
  }' \
  "$API_BASE/meta/whatsapp/v24.0/$PHONE_NUMBER_ID/messages"
# → {"success":true}
```

The typing indicator ("typing…" dots) auto-clears after ~25 seconds OR the moment you send any message. For long-running work, re-fire this call every <25s (e.g. right before you POST your reply) to keep the dots visible. Drop the `typing_indicator` field to mark-as-read only.

## Send a reaction

```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messaging_product": "whatsapp",
    "recipient_type": "individual",
    "to": "<phone>",
    "type": "reaction",
    "reaction": { "message_id": "<wamid>", "emoji": "👀" }
  }' \
  "$API_BASE/meta/whatsapp/v24.0/$PHONE_NUMBER_ID/messages"
```

A user can have only ONE reaction per message — sending a new emoji REPLACES the previous one (no explicit remove needed). Send `"emoji": ""` to clear a reaction entirely.

## Send a template (outside the 24h window)

If `send-whatsapp-message` returns `sessionWindowExpired: true`, fall through to this path. WhatsApp only allows pre-approved templates outside the 24h customer-service window.

```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messaging_product": "whatsapp",
    "to": "<phone>",
    "type": "template",
    "template": {
      "name": "<template_name>",
      "language": { "code": "en_US" }
    }
  }' \
  "$API_BASE/meta/whatsapp/v24.0/$PHONE_NUMBER_ID/messages"
```

List approved templates first: `GET $API_BASE/platform/v1/whatsapp/templates?phone_number_id=$PHONE_NUMBER_ID`.

## Webhook signature verification

Every Kapso webhook delivery includes `X-Webhook-Signature: <hex>` (HMAC-SHA256 of the raw body using `KAPSO_WEBHOOK_HMAC_SECRET`). The native handler (`/api/integrations/kapso/webhook`) and the workflow webhook trigger both verify automatically — the trigger's `hmacHeader` is `X-Webhook-Signature` and `hmacSecret` resolves from swarm config.

To verify manually:

```bash
echo -n "$RAW_BODY" | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "$HMAC_SECRET" -hex | awk '{print $2}'
# Compare hex output with X-Webhook-Signature header (constant-time compare in production).
```

## Reply etiquette

- Same language as the inbound message — match whatever the human wrote in.
- Brief. WhatsApp is not Slack — 1-3 short messages max.
- Identify yourself if it's a first interaction in the conversation, e.g. "Hi! This is the swarm's WhatsApp assistant."
- Quote-reply (`context.message_id`) when answering a specific question.
- If you can't help (no skill for the request, out of scope) — say so and either escalate to Lead or ask the human to use another channel.
- Always log the outbound wamid in your task output so it's traceable.

## Where this fits in the swarm

Two inbound paths can exist (the native handler, or a workflow path as the alternative):

- **Native handler** (`/api/integrations/kapso/webhook`) — fires for any phone number registered via `register-kapso-number`. Verifies HMAC, dedupes by message id (KV `integrations:kapso:dedupe`, 24h TTL), reads the routing mapping from KV (`integrations:kapso:numbers`), and either dispatches a `kapso-inbound` task or delegates to a workflow trigger (advanced override). Also emits a `kapso.message.received` event on the workflow event bus.
- **Workflow path** — fires for unregistered numbers (or numbers whose mapping points at a workflow). A typical inbound-handling workflow chains: a react-eyes step (mark read + typing + 👀) → a debounce step (collapse rapid-fire bursts) → a gate → an agent-task triage step → a finalize step (✅/❌ reaction).

**Debounce / batching:** a debounce step waits a few seconds after each message and only the LAST message of a burst proceeds to the agent task — so a user firing 3 quick messages produces ONE task, not three. The agent is told the `batchSize` and should read trailing history and answer the whole burst in one reply. When >1 messages are collapsed, the user can be shown a "🧵 Got your N messages" note.

The agent-task triages like any other interaction; route heavier work to specialists via `send-task` (always include the WhatsApp source context so they can reply back).

HMAC verification is enforced (signed mode) on both paths.

## Common gotchas

- Phone numbers from Kapso are E.164 **without `+`** (e.g. `15551234567`). Add `+` when displaying to humans, drop it when calling the API.
- `message.text.body` is only present for `type:"text"`. For other types read `message.<type>` (see the table above) or `message.kapso.content` for a text representation.
- Outbound status events (`delivered`, `read`) are NOT a customer interaction — skip them. Filter by `message.kapso.direction == "inbound"`.
- Real inbound messages commonly arrive with `status: "delivered"` (delivered to the swarm). Do NOT skip on status — only `direction` signals inbound vs outbound.
- Kapso sometimes sends test payloads with `"test": true` and `wamid.TEST_*` ids. Don't reply to test payloads — just complete the task with a note.
- `KAPSO_PHONE_NUMBER_ID` is the **swarm's own** number, not the recipient's. The recipient is in `message.from` / `conversation.phone_number`.
- The message-list endpoint is `/platform/v1/whatsapp/messages?conversation_id=X` — the conversation-scoped `/conversations/<id>/messages` path 404s.
- **Wide images shrink — pad them, don't send as document.** `type:image` scales to bubble width; a wide social card becomes a strip. Sending it as `type:document` removes the preview entirely. Fix: pad onto a ~1:1/4:5 canvas and send as `type:image`. See "Sending media".
- **MCP tools cover text-only.** `send-whatsapp-message` and `reply-whatsapp-message` are deliberately thin — templates / media / reactions / typing / mark-as-read are NOT in the tool surface. For those, use the REST recipes in this skill directly.
