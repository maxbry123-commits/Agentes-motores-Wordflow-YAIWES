"""Structural call-graph reasoning (issue #39).

A faithful Python port of the chiasmus call-graph engine
(https://github.com/yogthos/chiasmus, `src/graph/`), scoped to what the shipped
#39 integration points need. Builds a precomputed CodeGraph from tree-sitter
extraction and answers callers / callees / reachability / path / impact /
cycles / dead-code / entry-points natively (O(V+E), no solver), with a
per-file-hash cache for incremental recompute.

Provenance (ported behavior-for-behavior):
  types.py    <- src/graph/types.ts
  extract.py  <- src/graph/extractor.ts (walkPython)
  analyses.py <- src/graph/native-analyses.ts + entry-points.ts
  resolve.py  <- src/graph/suffix-index.ts (adapted to Python modules)
  cache.py    <- src/graph/cache.ts (in-process)

See docs/reports/CALL_GRAPH_REASONING_V3.md.

The package facade exports only what production imports (pipeline.py and
main.py); tests import the submodules directly.
