"""The proxy's control-plane endpoints, against a running stack.

/cancel and /v1/permission are how a user stops a runaway turn and how the
default permission mode approves a destructive call. Both were untested: every
session measured in this campaign ran in yolo mode and none was ever
cancelled, so the endpoints a user actually reaches for had no coverage.

These are contract checks — status codes and error shapes — which is what
matters for a client that has to distinguish "no such session" from "bad
request" from "wrong method". Live-stack test: carries the integration marker
and is deselected by default.
