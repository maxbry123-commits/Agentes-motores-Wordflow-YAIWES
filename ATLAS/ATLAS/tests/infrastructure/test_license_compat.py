"""License-compatibility check for production Python dependencies.

Every dependency declared in the production requirements files must have
a KNOWN, allowlisted license (permissive or otherwise compatible with
the project's AGPL-3.0-or-later distribution). An unknown/unlisted
dependency fails the check so a new dep with an incompatible or
unvetted license is caught in CI before it ships.

Licenses are recorded in DEP_LICENSES (spot-checked against each
package's published metadata; see THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md). Parsing only
— installs nothing, reaches no network.
