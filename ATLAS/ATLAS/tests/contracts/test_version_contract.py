"""Version-string parity across every surface that states a release.

pyproject.toml is the single source of truth. Each documentation or
code surface that repeats the version (package __version__, README
badges, ARCHITECTURE header, CHANGELOG top entry, SUPPORT_MATRIX
applies-to line, translated README badges) must agree, so a release
bump can't leave a stale number behind. Parsing only.
