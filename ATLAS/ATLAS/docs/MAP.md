# ATLAS Repository Map

Orientation map for the repository: what each top-level directory owns and where
the documentation lives. For component internals see
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md); for the full API surface see
[API.md](API.md).

---

## Top-level directories

| Directory | Owns | More |
|---|---|---|
| `proxy/` | Go agent loop: `/v1/agent`, grammar-constrained tool calls, gates, V3 routing, OpenAI passthrough | [proxy/README.md](../proxy/README.md) |
| `tui/` | Bubbletea terminal client — the canonical chat front-end, consumes proxy SSE streams | — |
| `atlas/` | Python CLI package: `atlas` subcommand dispatch (init, doctor, tier, model, onboard, lens, asa, publish, bench, compose, tui, upgrade, rollback, diagnostics, artifact, config); `atlas/bench/` is the benchmark harness | [atlas/bench/README.md](../atlas/bench/README.md) |
| `v3-service/` | Python HTTP service for the V3 generation pipeline (`stages/` holds the pipeline stage modules, `graph/` the ATLAS_CALL_GRAPH layer) and the tree-sitter structural tooling | — |
| `geometric-lens/` | Scoring (C(x)/G(x)), the pattern cache, ASA control-vector build | [asa_calibration/README.md](../geometric-lens/asa_calibration/README.md) |
| `sandbox/` | Isolated multi-language code execution and shell, with workspace containment | — |
| `inference/` | llama-server Docker builds (CUDA / ROCm / Vulkan) and model-neutral entrypoints | — |
| `benchmark/` | Created at runtime, not tracked — dataset caches and run results. The runner/harness code is `atlas/bench/` | — |
| `scripts/` | Install, deploy, K3s, and CI/release automation | — |
| `.github/` | CI workflows, `CODEOWNERS`, `dependabot.yml`, `allowed_signers` for signed release tags, issue templates | — |
| `templates/` | K3s manifest templates rendered from `atlas.conf` via envsubst | — |
| `tests/` | Cross-cutting test suite: `cli/`, `concurrency/`, `contracts/` (doc-link, version and config gates), `e2e/` (the acceptance suite CI runs), `infrastructure/`, `integration/`, `perf/`, `v3/`, `v3-service/` | — |

Root also holds the Docker Compose stack (`docker-compose.yml` plus the rocm /
vulkan / cpu / macos overlays), `atlas.conf.example` (K3s), `pyproject.toml`
(the `atlas` CLI entry point), and the standard `.env.example`.
