#!/bin/bash
# Detect DB migration numbering conflicts.
#
# Migrations live in src/be/migrations/NNN_descriptive_name.sql and are applied
# forward-only in numeric NNN order. Two PRs branched off the same main can each
# add a migration with the same NNN; in isolation each PR looks fine, so the
# collision slips past review and lands two files sharing one NNN.
#
# This script globs the checked-out tree and fails if any NNN prefix appears on
# more than one file. On GitHub pull_request events the merge ref is checked out
# (PR merged into base), so both a base-vs-branch collision and a within-PR
# duplicate surface as two files sharing one NNN — no diff-against-main needed.
#
# It also fails if a migration that exists on the base branch was renamed,
# renumbered, modified, or deleted. Migrations on main may already be applied
# in production; the runner tracks them by numeric version, so renumbering an
# applied file makes the runner silently skip the new file that took its number
# (incident 2026-06-10: 090_model_tiers skipped after 090→091 renumber).
#
# Runnable locally too: bash scripts/check-migration-conflicts.sh
# Base ref for the immutability check defaults to origin/main; override with
# MIGRATION_BASE_REF. Skipped (with a notice) when the base ref is missing or
# is not an ancestor of HEAD — CI enforces it on the PR merge ref.
