/**
 * Built-in global scripts catalog — the one concrete {@link Seeder} wired into
 * the generic seeder framework (see `src/be/seed`).
 *
 * Each entry's runtime source is a real `.ts` file under `./catalog/`, imported
 * here as text so it ships embedded in the compiled binary. {@link scriptsSeeder}
 * mirrors the `/api/scripts/upsert` pipeline (import allowlist -> typecheck ->
 * signature + argsSchema extraction -> upsert at `global` scope). The framework
 * harness makes re-seeding version-aware: a pristine script updates when its
 * catalog source changes, a user-modified one is preserved.
 *
 * To add a script: drop a `<name>.ts` file in `./catalog/`, text-import it below,
 * and add a manifest entry to {@link SEED_SCRIPTS}. The `description` + `intent`
 * power `script-search` ranking — write them with the keywords an agent would
 * actually search for.
