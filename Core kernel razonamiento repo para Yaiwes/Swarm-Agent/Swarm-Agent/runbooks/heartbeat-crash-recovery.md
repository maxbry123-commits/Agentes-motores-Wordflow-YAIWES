# Heartbeat & Crash-Recovery Flow

> **Maintained doc — current logic only (no history).** This runbook is the canonical reference for the heartbeat sweep, the stalled-task classifier, and the crash-recovery routing heuristic. Keep the diagrams + pseudocode in sync with the code: when you change any of this logic, update this file in the same PR (enforced by the CLAUDE.md rule). It documents *current* behavior — do not turn it into a changelog.

Owner code: `src/heartbeat/heartbeat.ts`, `src/tasks/worker-follow-up.ts`, plus the assignment/claim path in `src/http/poll.ts`, `src/tools/task-action.ts`, `src/tools/send-task.ts`, and `src/be/db.ts`.

## 1. The heartbeat sweep (every ~90s)

`runHeartbeatSweep` → `codeLevelTriage` runs on `DEFAULT_INTERVAL_MS` (90s, env `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS`):

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  tick["Heartbeat tick (~90s)<br/>codeLevelTriage()"] --> expire["expireStaleRuntimeInstances() (§1a)<br/>multi-runtime only"]
  expire --> detect["detectAndRemediateStalledTasks()"]
  detect --> health["checkWorkerHealth()<br/>busy ↔ idle (skips offline)"]
  health --> cleanup["cleanupStaleResources()<br/>stale sessions (30m), reviewing,<br/>inbox, mentions, workflow runs,<br/>+ reaper: escalate unreclaimed pinned resumes (§3)<br/>+ escalateStarvedPoolTasks: zero-eligible-agent pool tasks (§4)"]

  boot["Server boot (once)"] --> reboot["runRebootSweep()<br/>in_progress w/ no session<br/>OR pre-boot stale session<br/>→ failTask + retry child<br/>(pinned to original agent when recoverable, §4)"]
```

- **Reboot sweep liveness predicate** (`runRebootSweep`): a session is considered "live, skip" only if `lastHeartbeatAt >= bootEpoch - 5s` (boot epoch parsed from `globalThis.__runId` = `run_<epochMs>`). Sessions with pre-boot heartbeats are stale artifacts that survived the WAL-mode SQLite restart and are treated as absent → auto-fail + retry child. If `__runId` is missing/unparseable, falls back to the legacy behavior (session exists → skip) — never more aggressive than before. This is **concurrency-safe**: a worker with N concurrent tasks keeps fresh (post-boot) heartbeats on its live sessions; only genuinely stale ones get classified.
- The **boot-triage seed script** (`src/be/seed-scripts/catalog/boot-triage.ts`) mirrors this logic: it flags `in_progress` tasks that are on an offline agent OR whose session's `lastHeartbeatAt` is older than `stuckMinutes` ago (no fresh session heartbeat).
- `autoAssignPoolTasks` and `claimTask`/`assignUnassignedTaskPending` are gated by the **routing-affinity eligibility check** (§4, `isAgentEligibleForTask`) — a pooled task tagged with a `routingAffinity` snapshot (from a resume/retry, or an explicit `requiredCapabilities` on a fresh `send-task`) can only go to a role/capability-matching agent. Untagged tasks are unaffected — assignment stays open to any idle (non-lead) worker, exactly as before. `autoAssignPoolTasks` **does** skip idle workers whose `emptyPollCount >= MAX_EMPTY_POLLS` (the poll gate) — assigning to them would just have them exit on their next poll. The filter reads `emptyPollCount` off the rows `getIdleWorkersWithCapacity()` already returns (no per-worker re-query). Note the poll gate is cleared on a genuine `waiting_for_credentials -> ready` recovery (`updateAgentCredentialState`) and on re-register, but **not** by routine post-task `ready:true` credential reports.
- `checkWorkerHealth` only flips `busy↔idle` (it pre-filters `offline`) and never sets `offline`. A successful `/api/poll` dispatch updates the agent to `busy` in the same transaction that starts a pre-assigned task or claims a pool task; the worker-only `poll-task` tool does the same for its direct pending-task path. The heartbeat sweep remains the reconciliation backstop for any other task-state transition that leaves `agents.status` stale. Leads can become `busy` while running a directly assigned task, but remain structurally excluded from pool assignment (`getIdleWorkersWithCapacity` and the pool dispatch query filter `isLead=0`). `offline` has two writers: the graceful `POST /close` handler (`src/http/core.ts`), and — only when `MULTI_RUNTIME_ENABLED` is set — the stale-runtime expiry in §1a. With the flag off (the default), a hard-crashed (SIGKILL) worker is still never auto-offlined.

## 1a. Runtime liveness (`MULTI_RUNTIME_ENABLED` only)

With multi-runtime mode enabled, one logical agent may be served by several
worker processes, each recorded in `runtime_instances`. Workers send their per-boot `X-Runtime-Instance-ID` on `POST /ping` and on
`GET /api/poll`; either refreshes that row's `last_seen_at`, so liveness
tracks actual worker traffic rather than one endpoint's cadence — a worker
sitting inside the long-poll loop keeps itself fresh. `POST /close` retires
just that row. Neither can revive a retired or expired runtime: the refresh
only matches a row that is already live, and registration is the sole path
back to `active`.

A crashed, OOM-killed, or network-partitioned process never reaches `/close`,
so status alone would leave it `active` forever and keep its agent falsely
available. Liveness is therefore the conjunction of `status = 'active'` and a
`last_seen_at` newer than `RUNTIME_STALE_THRESHOLD_MIN` (default 5 min, well
above the worker's poll/ping traffic interval, so an idle-but-healthy worker
is never expired):

- `countActiveRuntimeInstancesForAgent` counts only live rows, so a surviving
  runtime's `/close` takes the agent offline immediately when its siblings are
  already stale rather than waiting for a sweep.
- `expireStaleRuntimeInstances` runs **first in the sweep**, before
  `autoAssignPoolTasks`. Assigning before expiry would hand a pool task to an
  agent the same sweep is about to mark offline, stranding it — nothing would
  be left to poll for it. `autoAssignPoolTasks` additionally skips agents that
  have runtime rows but none live.
- Credential readiness is recorded per runtime, and the logical agent's status
  is derived from its live runtimes: offline when none are live, otherwise
  `waiting_for_credentials` only when no live runtime is ready, else the normal
  busy/idle from active work. Task remediation follows the same rule — it never
  returns an agent to idle while no runtime is serving it.
- Expiry retires stale runtimes and marks any agent with no live runtime left
  `offline`. It deliberately does **not** delete active sessions: runtime
  liveness answers "may this process acquire NEW work?", not "is its current
  work dead?". Sessions are heartbeated by tool activity only (§2 note), so a
  healthy worker inside a long model call or shell command can be quiet past
  the runtime cutoff — and runtime rows freeze entirely while the flag is off,
  so re-enabling it must not read every healthy worker as crashed. Crash
  classification stays owned by the stalled-task classifier (§2 Case B:
  session heartbeat **and** task both past its stronger threshold), which
  cleans the session when it remediates; the sweep's 30-minute stale-session
  cleanup backstops any leftover row. The worker's next re-registration
  restores its runtime row.
- Retired rows are **deleted, not kept**. Runtime identity is per boot, so
  retaining them would add one row per boot per agent indefinitely; nothing
  reads a runtime once it stops being live.
- The whole mechanism is inert while the flag is off. After a rollback workers
  stop refreshing their rows, and expiring them would offline agents that are
  running fine under legacy semantics.

Registration is the only path that sets a runtime back to `active`, so a
delayed ping from a retired or unknown runtime cannot resurrect it.

Startup session cleanup is disabled in this mode: several processes share one
agent id, and a booting worker has no evidence that distinguishes its crashed
predecessor's session from a live-but-quiet sibling's (sessions heartbeat on
tool activity only, and a live worker's runtime may have no row at all during
the activation window). A crashed boot's task is reclaimed by the stalled-task
classifier (§2 Case B) once both its session heartbeat and the task go stale;
the sweep's stale-session cleanup backstops leftover rows. With the flag off,
boot cleanup keeps its legacy behavior (one process per agent, so every
session of the agent is a dead predecessor's).

## 2. The stalled-task classifier (`detectAndRemediateStalledTasks`)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  cand{"candidate?<br/>status = in_progress<br/>AND lastUpdatedAt > 5m"} -- no --> skip["leave as-is"]
  cand -- yes --> steer{"fresh pending steering?<br/>age < 5m"}
  steer -- yes --> defer["defer this sweep"]
  steer -- no --> cls{"classify (per task)"}
  cls -->|"A — no active session<br/>AND taskAge ≥ 5m"| remA["remediateCrashedWorkerTask<br/>reason = crash_recovery"]
  cls -->|"B — session stale<br/>hb ≥ 15m AND taskAge ≥ 15m"| remB["remediateCrashedWorkerTask<br/>reason = crash_recovery<br/>(+ cleanup session)"]
  cls -->|"C — session fresh<br/>AND taskAge ≥ 30m"| esc["escalate to Lead<br/>(stalledTasks, no auto-fail)"]
```

- Candidate set = `getStalledInProgressTasks(STALL_THRESHOLD_NO_SESSION_MIN)` → `status='in_progress' AND lastUpdatedAt > 5m`. Tasks in `pending`/`offered` are **not** seen by this sweep. A candidate with a pending steering message newer than `STEERING_STALL_GRACE_MIN` is deferred for that sweep; once the bounded grace expires, normal classification and remediation resume.
- An **active_session** = one worker-*run* process for a task (`active_sessions`, `UNIQUE(taskId)`), created lazily *after* the provider process spawns, heartbeated by **tool activity** (throttled ~5s; no wall-clock ping between tool calls). "No active session" is AND-gated with `lastUpdatedAt > 5m`, so it means *"no live run **and** no task progress in 5 min."* It can false-positive on a long-but-quiet live worker; the resume-generation budget (`MAX_RESUME_GENERATIONS`) bounds the blast radius.
- Thresholds (env-overridable): `STALL_THRESHOLD_NO_SESSION_MIN=5` (`HEARTBEAT_STALL_NO_SESSION_MIN`), `STALL_THRESHOLD_STALE_HEARTBEAT_MIN=15`, `STALL_THRESHOLD_MINUTES=30`, `STEERING_STALL_GRACE_MIN=5` (`HEARTBEAT_STEERING_GRACE_MIN`), `STALE_CLEANUP_THRESHOLD_MINUTES=30`.

## 3. Protected resume routing heuristic (`remediateCrashedWorkerTask` / shutdown → `createResumeFollowUp` → reaper)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  entry["supersedeTask(parent) → frees capacity,<br/>then createResumeFollowUp(crash_recovery<br/>or graceful_shutdown)"]
  entry --> gate{"original agent row exists,<br/>status≠offline, hasCap?<br/>(protected reasons IGNORE the 30s fresh gate)"}
  gate -->|"yes (recoverable / restarting)"| pin["resume = PENDING, agentId = parent<br/>(reclaimed on the agent's next poll —<br/>never enters the pool)"]
  gate -->|"no — offline / row gone / at capacity /<br/>pin kill-switch=0"| pool["resume = UNASSIGNED → pool<br/>(genuinely-gone / rollback path)"]
  pin --> reap{"reaper (every sweep, in cleanupStaleResources):<br/>still PENDING after<br/>HEARTBEAT_RESUME_PIN_GRACE_MIN?"}
  reap -->|"no — agent reclaimed it"| ok["runs on the original agent"]
  reap -->|"yes — never reclaimed"| esc["atomically cancel the pin, then<br/>createRerouteDecisionTask → Lead<br/>(over generation cap → fail, no decision)"]
  esc --> lead["Lead re-delegates via send-task(agentId=…)<br/>— explicit agent, never re-pooled"]
```

**Heuristic (current):** `crash_recovery` and `graceful_shutdown` resumes are **pinned back to their own (stable-ID) agent**. `createResumeFollowUp` sets `agentId = parent.agentId` whenever the agent row still exists, is not `offline`, and has capacity — *regardless of the 30s `WORKER_LIVENESS_WINDOW_SECONDS` freshness*. The agent ID survives both crash recovery and deploy/SIGTERM graceful shutdown, so "stale" usually means "restarting", not "gone". The resume is `pending` and reclaimed on the agent's next poll; it **never enters the role-blind pool**, so no wrong-specialization worker can grab it (DES-523). It falls back to the pool only when the agent is genuinely gone (`offline`), its row is absent, capacity is full, or the reason-specific rollback switch is `0` (`HEARTBEAT_PIN_CRASH_RESUME` for crash recovery, `HEARTBEAT_PIN_GRACEFUL_RESUME` for graceful shutdown). Other reasons (`context_limits` / `manual_supersede`) still require `fresh`.

A pin **never reclaimed within `HEARTBEAT_RESUME_PIN_GRACE_MIN`** (the agent that looked recoverable never returned) is escalated by the **reaper** (`escalateUnreclaimedResumes`, run inside `cleanupStaleResources` on *every* sweep, including the post-reboot sweep): it atomically cancels the still-`pending` resume (skipping if the agent reclaimed it in the gap — TOCTOU-safe) and creates a Lead-owned `task.reroute.decision` follow-up. The Lead re-delegates via `send-task` with an **explicit `agentId`** — the work is never re-pooled. A resume already at the generation cap (`MAX_RESUME_GENERATIONS`) is failed instead of escalated, bounding a flapping task. Net: protected pinned reasons touch the unassigned pool **zero times** unless a fail-open guard or rollback switch sends them there.

### Pseudocode (current)

```text
# detector → on Case A / B:
if task has pending steering newer than STEERING_STALL_GRACE_MIN:
    defer this sweep                            # bounded; expiry resumes normal remediation
supersedeTask(parent)                      # frees the agent's in_progress slot
promotePendingSteeringForTask(parent)       # pending rows → follow-up tasks, exactly once
resume = createResumeFollowUp(parent, reason = crash_recovery | graceful_shutdown):
    preferredAgentId = undefined
    if parent.agentId:
        cand = getAgentById(parent.agentId)
        if cand and cand.status != "offline" and activeCount(cand) < cand.maxTasks:
            isCrash = (reason == crash_recovery) and HEARTBEAT_PIN_CRASH_RESUME
            isGraceful = (reason == graceful_shutdown) and HEARTBEAT_PIN_GRACEFUL_RESUME
            isFreshReason = (reason != graceful_shutdown) and (now - cand.lastActivityAt < 30s)
            if isCrash or isGraceful or isFreshReason:   # protected reasons IGNORE the fresh gate
                preferredAgentId = cand.id
    tags = [auto-resume, reason:<r>, resume-generation:<n>]
    if reason == crash_recovery and preferredAgentId: tags += [crash-recovery-pin]   # mark a GENUINE pin
    if reason == graceful_shutdown and preferredAgentId: tags += [graceful-shutdown-pin]
    createTaskExtended(resume, agentId = preferredAgentId, tags = tags)
    #   agentId set  → status = pending  (PINNED to the original agent)
    #   agentId none → status = unassigned (pool — only genuinely-gone / rollback)

# every sweep, inside cleanupStaleResources:
escalateUnreclaimedResumes():
    for r in getStalePinnedResumes(grace):    # tagged crash-recovery-pin OR graceful-shutdown-pin, status=pending, createdAt < now-grace
        if getResumeGeneration(r) >= MAX_RESUME_GENERATIONS:
            failPendingResumeIfUnclaimed(r, "failed", budget_exhausted); continue   # bound flapping
        if no lead: continue                          # leave pending — nothing to escalate to
        transaction:                                  # atomic: all-or-nothing, else roll back + retry next sweep
            if not failPendingResumeIfUnclaimed(r, "cancelled", …): abort  # agent reclaimed it in the gap → skip
            repointTrackerSyncBySwarmId(r.id, original.id)    # return the external-tracker link
            createRerouteDecisionTask(original, staleResume = r) → Lead    # Lead re-delegates via send-task(agentId=…)
```

> The `crash-recovery-pin` and `graceful-shutdown-pin` tags are the reaper's scoping keys: only genuine same-agent pins carry them, so a *pooled* resume that `autoAssignPoolTasks` later flips to `pending` (keeping its old `createdAt`) is never mistaken for a stale pin and reaped.

## 4. Routing affinity — role/capability gate on every pool consumer

**Goal:** a task interrupted by ANY event (crash, graceful shutdown, reboot, pool redispatch) must only ever land on an agent whose role matches the original assignee's role — and, where declared, whose capabilities cover the task's requirements. When no eligible agent exists, the task queues and is escalated to the Lead — it never falls to an arbitrary idle worker. Kill-switch: `POOL_AFFINITY_ENFORCEMENT=0` restores the pre-affinity, role-blind pool behavior verbatim; untagged tasks (no `routingAffinity`) are always unaffected.

`agent_tasks.routingAffinity` (migration 113) is a nullable JSON snapshot — `{ sourceAgentId?, role?, capabilities: string[], harnessProvider? }` (`RoutingAffinitySchema`, `src/types.ts`). `harnessProvider` is informational only (native session resume is deprecated — see §3's model-inheritance note) and never enforced.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  gate{"isAgentEligibleForTask(agent, task)"}
  gate -->|"enforcement off"| yes1["eligible"]
  gate -->|"task.routingAffinity is null"| yes2["eligible — untagged task"]
  gate -->|"affinity.sourceAgentId == agent.id"| yes3["eligible — own work"]
  gate -->|"agent.role or affinity.role missing"| no1["INELIGIBLE — no fail-open"]
  gate -->|"agent.role != affinity.role"| no2["INELIGIBLE"]
  gate -->|"affinity.capabilities ⊄ agent.capabilities"| no3["INELIGIBLE"]
  gate -->|"role matches, capabilities ⊆"| yes4["eligible"]
```

Every consumer of the `unassigned` pool calls the **same** `isAgentEligibleForTask` predicate (`src/be/db.ts`) — there is no second implementation to drift out of sync:

- `claimTask` / `assignUnassignedTaskPending` — pre-check before the atomic `UPDATE … WHERE status='unassigned'` (static per (agent, task), so it doesn't reopen the claim race). Rejection logs a distinct `task_claim_rejected_affinity` event and returns `null` — same shape as "already claimed by someone else", so existing callers (poll auto-claim, `task-action claim`) degrade safely.
- `getUnassignedTaskIdsForAgent` (replaces the unfiltered `getUnassignedTaskIds` on the poll auto-claim path in `src/http/poll.ts`) — pages through the pool in `max(limit * 5, ELIGIBILITY_SCAN_BATCH_SIZE)`-row windows, filtering each through the predicate, until `limit` eligible IDs are found or the pool is exhausted (capped at `ELIGIBILITY_SCAN_CAP` rows scanned), so an ineligible task is never even offered to the budget-admission gate. Before this paginated scan (PR #954 review), a single fixed window meant more than `~25` ineligible affinity-tagged tasks at the head of the priority order could hide all eligible work behind them, no matter how many times this was called.
- `autoAssignPoolTasks` — pages through the pool in `POOL_SCAN_BATCH_SIZE`-row windows (via `getUnassignedPoolTasks(limit, offset)`); for each task in a window (priority/creation order), picks the first idle worker that has capacity **and** passes the predicate. Continues to the next window until it has assigned `MAX_AUTO_ASSIGN_PER_SWEEP` tasks or exhausted the pool (capped at `POOL_SCAN_CAP` rows scanned this sweep); a task with no eligible worker anywhere in the scanned pool is left queued (not blindly assigned to the next worker in line). Same PR #954 fix: a single bounded fetch of `MAX_AUTO_ASSIGN_PER_SWEEP` rows used to mean a run of high-priority ineligible affinity tasks could suppress lower-priority eligible work indefinitely — every sweep re-fetched the same ineligible head-of-line rows, so the starvation never self-resolved even as idle eligible workers came and went.
- `task-action` `claim` — same predicate, with a human-readable rejection ("requires role X; yours is Y") so an agent can self-correct instead of retry-looping.

**Where a `routingAffinity` snapshot comes from** (`buildRoutingAffinityFromAgent(agentId)` snapshots an agent's current `role`/`harnessProvider`/`capabilities`; `createTaskExtended` auto-inherits a parent's `routingAffinity` on `parentTaskId` when the child doesn't set its own — same treatment as `vcsRepo`/`contextKey`):

1. **`createResumeFollowUp`** (§3) stamps a fresh snapshot from `parent.agentId` on **every** leg — pinned AND pool-fallback — so even a resume that falls to the pool (agent offline/gone/at-capacity, or a pin kill-switch off) is gated. Falls back to the parent's own inherited snapshot when the agent row is already gone.
2. **`runRebootSweep`**'s retry-child creation (§1) now applies the *same* recoverability gate `createResumeFollowUp` uses for its same-agent pin (row exists, not `offline`, has capacity — via the shared `getPinCandidateAgent` helper) — a recoverable retry is pinned `pending` to the original agent and tagged `reboot-retry-pin`; otherwise it falls to the pool with the snapshot stamped anyway. `getStalePinnedResumes`'s reaper scope (§3) now also covers `reboot-retry-pin`, so an unreclaimed reboot pin escalates to the Lead exactly like a crash/graceful pin (retry children are fresh tasks with no `resume-generation` tag, so the generation budget is 0 at first escalation — expected).
3. **`send-task`** / **`task-action create`** accept an optional `requiredCapabilities: string[]` — written into a fresh pool task's `routingAffinity` with `role` left unset. Per the predicate above, a capabilities-only snapshot (no `role`) is eligible for nobody but its declaring agent (n/a here — there is none), so such a task always ends up escalated to the Lead by §4's starvation check below; it's a way to *record* a requirement for the Lead's judgment, not to auto-route today.

**Starvation escalation** (`escalateStarvedPoolTasks`, wired into `cleanupStaleResources` — runs every sweep): an `unassigned` task carrying a `routingAffinity`, queued longer than `POOL_AFFINITY_ESCALATION_MIN`, with **zero eligible registered agents** (any status — an offline-but-matching agent still counts as "not starved"; this is "nobody of that role exists", not "everyone's busy right now") gets a Lead `task.pool.starved.decision` follow-up (`createPoolStarvationDecisionTask`, same `taskType: "reroute-decision"` discriminator and idempotency check as §3's `createRerouteDecisionTask` — no `staleResume`/generation budget since the task was never pinned).

## Quick reference — env knobs

All of these are read **dynamically** — `heartbeat.ts` exposes them as getter
functions (`stallThresholdMinutes()`, `maxAutoAssignPerSweep()`,
`maxResumeGenerations()`, …) rather than module-level `const`s. Module-level
capture ran before `loadGlobalConfigsIntoEnv()` hydrated `swarm_config` into
`process.env`, so a value saved from the dashboard's Configuration page was
ignored even across a restart. Because the sweep re-reads them, a config reload
now applies immediately to every threshold below **except** the two that size
the `setInterval` itself (`HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS`, and `HEARTBEAT_DISABLE`
which decides whether the interval is created at all) — those are read once in
`src/http/index.ts` after hydration, so they need a restart.

Rollback switches accept `0`/`false` interchangeably (both parse through
`parseEnvFlag` in `src/utils/env-flag.ts`); `HEARTBEAT_PIN_CRASH_RESUME` and
`POOL_AFFINITY_ENFORCEMENT` previously honoured only `0`.

## Queue-pickup stall alarm (API process)

The queue alarm is deliberately outside the worker runner, swarm scheduler, and heartbeat checklist task. `startQueueStallAlarm` starts directly in the API process after Slack connects, including when `HEARTBEAT_DISABLE` is set. Every five minutes it queries ready `pending`/`unassigned` rows and alerts `SLACK_ALERTS_CHANNEL` when the oldest claimable task has waited at least 30 minutes.

The non-empty queue is the denominator: an empty queue never alarms merely because there were zero pickups. DAG nodes with incomplete dependencies are excluded. The alert includes the claimable count, oldest task ID/age, and the number of `pending|unassigned → in_progress` transitions in the same 30-minute window. Delivery is direct through the API process's Slack client—no agent task is created or claimed. One alert is sent per stall episode, followed by a recovery notice; a failed delivery does not arm the dedup state, so the next tick retries.
