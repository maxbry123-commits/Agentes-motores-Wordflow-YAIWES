// Configuration catalog — single source of truth for the /settings/configuration

// Each entry maps to a **non-secret** `swarm_config` row in the `global` scope
// (the same store the Integrations UI writes to). Env vars win at boot; a value
// saved here becomes effective after the server's debounced auto-reload (or the
// explicit "Reload config" button). Entries flagged `restartRequired` are read
// once at process start and need a full server restart.
//
// Reserved keys (`API_KEY`, `SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`) and anything
// credential-shaped are intentionally NOT listed here — secrets belong on the
// Integrations / Secrets pages, and the server rejects reserved keys outright
// (see `src/be/swarm-config-guard.ts`).
