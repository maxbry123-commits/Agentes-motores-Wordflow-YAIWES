/**
 * relay-pipeline (v8.0 round-11, Multi-worker, 3 workers)
 * ------------------------------------------------------
 * Calibrated spread: TODO(calibration) — fill frontierAvg / budgetAvg / gap from
 * the round-11 sweep (anchors: claude-opus-4.8, codex-5.6-sol vs pi-deepseek-flash,
 * claude-haiku). Ship gate: frontierAvg − budgetAvg ≥ 0.2. Target ~0.4 → 0.9.
 *
 * Three workers form a CHAINED TRANSFORM PIPELINE. Worker A (worker 0) reads a
 * random per-attempt source payload seeded ONLY on its sandbox, applies the
 * stage-1 transform, and publishes the result into swarm memory under a channel
 * tag. Worker B (worker 1, dependsOn A) retrieves stage-1's output from memory,
 * applies the stage-2 transform, and re-publishes. Worker C (worker 2, dependsOn
 * B) retrieves stage-2's output, applies the stage-3 transform, and writes the
 * final result. Each worker also writes its own stage's result to a receipt file
 * on its own sandbox.
 *
 * Each stage's fidelity is INDEPENDENTLY checkable: the grader recomputes every
 * stage's expected output by folding the (pure, deterministic) stage transforms
 * over the seeded source, then compares line-for-line against each stage's
 * receipt (`pipelineStagesCorrect` → score = stages correct / total). Because the
 * stages are dependency-chained, a corruption at stage k naturally tanks stages
 * k+1… — chained deps give natural partial credit. Crucially, each stage is
 * scored against the recomputed truth (anchored to the seed), NOT against the
 * previous worker's actual receipt, so a downstream worker that faithfully
 * transforms a WRONG input still scores 0 on its own stage.
 *
 * Reuses the cross-worker `workers: 3` + `seed.exec` (writable scratch dirs) +
 * `dependsOn` + per-worker `fileAbsentOnWorker` machinery from the old
 * `relay-handoff` scenario, generalized to a graded multi-stage transform chain
 * (`pipelineStagesCorrect`).
 *
 * Requires an embedding key in evals/.env (EMBEDDING_API_KEY or OPENAI_API_KEY)
 * for the swarm memory store/search the handoff relies on — same as the old
 * relay-handoff scenario.
 *
 * Grading:
 *   - `correctness` (weight 3): the FRACTION of the three pipeline stages whose
 *       receipt file exactly matches the recomputed expected output — graded via
 *       `pipelineStagesCorrect`, which reads the seeded source from A at grade
 *       time (the payload is per-attempt random) and folds the stage transforms
 *       over it. Partial credit so a pipeline that got stage 1 right but botched
 *       stage 2 ranks above one that botched stage 1.
 *   - `completeness` (weight 1): a deterministic check that ALL THREE stage
 *       receipts EXIST and are non-empty — a worker that skipped its stage (no
 *       receipt) is incomplete even if its upstream stages were correct. This is
 *       graded (fraction of receipts present) so a partial pipeline still
 *       discriminates.
 *
 * Anti-gaming (checklist applied to THIS scenario):
 *   - The source payload is GENERATED AT RUNTIME on worker A's sandbox from
 *     /dev/urandom (random ids + shuffled words) — it is NOT in any prompt,
 *     fixture, or seed file committed to the repo, so the correct stage outputs
 *     are NOT derivable from the task text. The grader recomputes the expected
 *     output from A's LIVE seeded source, never from a hard-coded answer.
 *   - Each stage is scored against the recomputed truth (anchored to the seed),
 *     NOT against the previous worker's receipt — so a downstream worker cannot
 *     "win" its stage by faithfully transforming a corrupted input, and echoing
 *     the prompt (which contains no payload values) scores 0.
 *   - The transforms are deterministic and unambiguous (filter even ids → keep
 *     values; sort+uppercase; reverse+number) so there is exactly one correct
 *     output per stage; a worker that guesses cannot match a multi-line payload.
 *   - The receipt files live on three filesystem-ISOLATED sandboxes;
 *     `fileAbsentOnWorker` proves A's source never leaked downstream (the handoff
 *     was through memory, not a shared disk) — echoing or disk-sharing can't
 *     satisfy it.
 *   - The grading rubric / per-stage line-match criteria are NOT shown to the
 *     workers; the prompt states the transform SPEC (what to compute) but not how
 *     it is graded.
