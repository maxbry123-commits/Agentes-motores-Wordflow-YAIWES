> **agent-swarm.dev is an open-source operating system for AI work: a lead agent breaks goals into tasks, routes them to specialized workers such as Claude Code or Codex, runs each worker in an isolated container, and preserves shared memory, tools, schedules, and review gates so delegated work compounds across sessions.**

> AI-Native · Compounds · Presence · Harness & LLM-Agnostic · Your Infra · Your Memory · 

## What it does

agent-swarm.dev runs a team of AI agents that coordinate autonomously. A **lead agent** receives tasks (from Slack, GitHub, GitLab, Linear, Jira, email, or the API), breaks them down, and delegates to **worker agents** running in isolated environments (Docker). Workers execute tasks, ship solutions, and write their learnings back to a shared memory so the whole swarm gets smarter every session.

You can run agents for Marketing, Product, UX, Engineering, Support, Operations, HR, Finance, or any role you can think of. A centralized Lead coordinates them, and they share the learnings horizontally. That's the true difference between [*AI First*](https://www.pleasedontdeploy.com/i/197193364/ai-first) and [*AI Native*](https://www.pleasedontdeploy.com/i/197193364/third-the-ai-native-metamorphosis).

agent-swarm.dev is the shared cloud brain and muscle that makes your whole company better every day.

Sometimes humans are the blocker. We can help you. Contact us [contact@desplega.sh](mailto:contact@desplega.sh).

> **The patterns that compound.** Five recipes show up in nearly every playbook — they're how the swarm stays reliable as it scales:
> **[Litmus Tests](https://docs.agent-swarm.dev/docs/playbooks/patterns/litmus-tests)** (LLM-as-judge quality gates) ·
> **[Drain Loops](https://docs.agent-swarm.dev/docs/playbooks/patterns/drain-loops)** (one ticket → a chain of reviewable PRs) ·
> **[HITL Gates](https://docs.agent-swarm.dev/docs/playbooks/patterns/hitl-gates)** (pause for human approval on irreversible steps) ·
> **[Per-Customer Working Directories](https://docs.agent-swarm.dev/docs/playbooks/patterns/per-customer-working-directories)** (context that compounds per account) ·
> **[No-op Workflows](https://docs.agent-swarm.dev/docs/playbooks/patterns/no-op-workflows)** (skip silently when nothing changed).

## Highlights

- **Lead/worker orchestration in Docker** — isolated dev environments, priority queues, pause/resume across deploys, and API-side alerts when claimable work stops being picked up. [Architecture →](https://docs.agent-swarm.dev/docs/architecture/overview)
- **Compounding memory & persistent identity** — agents explicitly capture reusable learnings with `memory-store`, remember past sessions, and evolve their own persona, expertise, and notes, with ratcheting file budgets and visible recovery when local edits exceed prompt limits. [Memory →](https://docs.agent-swarm.dev/docs/architecture/memory) · [Agents →](https://docs.agent-swarm.dev/docs/architecture/agents)
- **Hybrid + graph-linked memory recall** — memory retrieval can blend vector and full-text ranking, expand through linked memories, surface usefulness readouts, and let agents correct an existing memory without losing its ID or history. [Memory →](https://docs.agent-swarm.dev/docs/architecture/memory) · [MCP tools →](https://docs.agent-swarm.dev/docs/reference/mcp-tools#memory-tools)
- **Multi-channel inputs** — Slack, GitHub, GitLab, email, WhatsApp, Linear, Jira, and the HTTP API all create tasks. [Integrations](#integrations)
- **Slack operations and persistent thread trees** — lead agents can create, populate, and archive channels, while conversations can opt in to one editable task tree with streamed outcome cards and explicit Block Kit messages. [Slack guide →](https://docs.agent-swarm.dev/docs/guides/slack-integration)
- **Workflow engine with Human-in-the-Loop** — DAG-based automation with approval gates, retries, structured I/O, and `foreach` fan-out that rejoins child agent tasks deterministically. [Workflows →](https://docs.agent-swarm.dev/docs/concepts/workflows)
- **Scheduled & recurring tasks** — cron-based automation for standing work, with schedules that can target agent tasks, workflows, or catalog scripts. [Scheduling →](https://docs.agent-swarm.dev/docs/concepts/scheduling)
- **Mid-run task steering** — add context at the next turn boundary, request an immediate interrupt where the harness supports it, or degrade safely to a follow-up task. [Task steering →](https://docs.agent-swarm.dev/docs/guides/task-steering)
- **Operator configuration UI** — tune non-secret feature flags, limits, integration toggles, and runtime defaults from Settings → Configuration, with source and restart-required indicators. [Configuration →](https://docs.agent-swarm.dev/docs/ui/configuration)
- **Asset namespaces** — group tasks, workflows, schedules, pages, apps, scripts, and mapped files under canonical shared or personal keys, with inheritance, subtree filtering, audited moves, and cross-entity discovery. [Asset namespaces →](https://docs.agent-swarm.dev/docs/guides/asset-namespaces)
- **Persistent shared files via agent-fs** — co-deploy agent-fs for shared task attachments, previews, and search; `store-progress` verifies attachment pointers before changing task state, late provisioning or config reloads activate the provider without an API restart, and tenant-authenticated control planes can invite shared-org members without receiving the bootstrap key. [Co-deployment guide →](https://docs.agent-swarm.dev/docs/guides/agent-fs-co-deployment)
- **Durable script workflows** — launch background script runs, inspect their journals, and track them from the dashboard when a one-shot `script-run` is too small. [Guide →](https://docs.agent-swarm.dev/docs/guides/script-workflow-runs)
- **Scripts-only MCP mode (code-mode)** — reduce the external MCP surface to eight script tools while retaining the full swarm SDK through `script-run`, cutting tool-schema context for capable coordinator models. [Guide →](https://docs.agent-swarm.dev/docs/guides/scripts-only-mode)
- **Scripts as external APIs** — expose a saved script as a public `POST /api/x/script/<id>` endpoint with optional bearer auth, typed input validation, and per-endpoint usage tracking. [Guide →](https://docs.agent-swarm.dev/docs/guides/scripts-external-apis)
- **Typed script API connections** — lead-managed OpenAPI, GraphQL, and MCP connections generate `ctx.api.*` / `ctx.mcp.*` clients for scripts, with credential bindings and OAuth-backed auth kept server-side. [Guide →](https://docs.agent-swarm.dev/docs/guides/script-connections)
- **Swarm Apps** — agents build versioned, schema-backed dashboard apps with reusable UI elements, named queries and actions, per-user settings, RBAC, history, and safe rollback. Models can also sync source-backed rows through owner-scoped script connections. [Apps API →](https://docs.agent-swarm.dev/docs/api-reference/apps)
- **E2B-backed eval harness** — run a scenario × harness-config matrix against real swarm stacks, capture transcripts/artifacts, and grade outcomes with deterministic checks plus LLM or agentic judges. [Guide →](https://docs.agent-swarm.dev/docs/guides/evals-harness)
- **Harness & LLM agnostic** — run with Claude Code, Claude Bridge, OpenAI Codex, pi-mono (Anthropic, OpenRouter, or Amazon Bedrock), Devin, Claude Managed Agents, raw LLMs, or opencode. The dashboard model picker follows a live models.dev catalog (with a bundled snapshot fallback), so newly released provider models appear without a redeploy. Route every OpenRouter-backed harness, workflow, and summarizer through an OpenAI-compatible gateway with `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL`. Tasks, schedules, and workflow agent-task nodes can use portable `modelTier` intent (`smol`, `regular`, `smart`, `ultra`), and operators can set per-agent reasoning effort (`off` → `max`, where supported) without changing task payloads. [Harness config →](https://docs.agent-swarm.dev/docs/guides/harness-configuration) · [Add a new provider →](https://docs.agent-swarm.dev/docs/guides/harness-providers)
- **Published release artifacts** — every release publishes multi-architecture API, full-worker, and slim-worker images alongside versioned E2B templates, the npm CLI package, and the Helm chart. [Artifact inventory →](https://docs.agent-swarm.dev/docs/guides/published-artifacts)
- **OpenTelemetry traces plus OTLP cost/token metrics** — export API + worker traces and finalized session cost/token counters through the same OTLP pipeline for dashboarding in SigNoz, Datadog, Tempo, or another compatible backend. [Observability →](https://docs.agent-swarm.dev/docs/guides/observability-opentelemetry)
- **Follow-up continuity across all harnesses** — child tasks inherit a bounded prior-task context preamble built from the task chain, so continuity survives restarts and works the same across every provider. [Task lifecycle →](https://docs.agent-swarm.dev/docs/concepts/task-lifecycle)
- **Skills & MCP servers** — reusable procedural knowledge, bundled skill reference files, and per-agent MCP servers with scope cascade. [MCP tools →](https://docs.agent-swarm.dev/docs/reference/mcp-tools)
- **External tool-router access** — the `x` command and `swarm_x` MCP tool let humans and agents execute approved third-party routes such as Composio without baking bespoke MCP servers first. [CLI →](https://docs.agent-swarm.dev/docs/reference/cli) · [Composio →](https://docs.agent-swarm.dev/docs/integrations/composio)
- **Config-driven metrics dashboards** — define read-only SQL widgets, version them, and render them in the dashboard without shipping custom frontend code. [Metrics API →](https://docs.agent-swarm.dev/docs/api-reference/stats)
- **DB-backed pages** — agents publish HTML or JSON pages (reports, dashboards, action specs) via `create_page`, remove stale pages with `delete-page`, and share them with public / authed / password modes, version history, view counters, diff helpers, and PDF export. [MCP tools → Pages](https://docs.agent-swarm.dev/docs/reference/mcp-tools#pages-tools)
- **KV store** — Redis-like namespaced key/value store with auto-scoped context (Slack thread / PR / Linear issue / page). [MCP tools → KV](https://docs.agent-swarm.dev/docs/reference/mcp-tools#kv-tools)
- **Real-time, themeable dashboard + task attachments** — monitor agents, tasks, per-user usage costs, and inter-agent chat; choose from built-in light/dark themes; filter tasks by requester; create tasks with uploaded files; and preview attachments inline above session prompts.

## Quick Start

Need help? Contact us at [contact@desplega.sh](mailto:contact@desplega.sh).

**Prerequisites:** [Docker](https://docker.com) and at least one supported harness credential. The default quick start assumes a [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) OAuth token (`claude setup-token`), but pi-mono / Bedrock, Codex, Devin, and other provider setups are also supported.

The fastest way is the onboarding wizard — it collects credentials, picks presets, and generates a working `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
bunx @desplega.ai/agent-swarm onboard
npx @desplega.ai/agent-swarm onboard
```

Prefer manual setup? Clone and run with Docker Compose:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/desplega-ai/agent-swarm.git
cd agent-swarm
cp .env.docker.example .env
# edit .env — set API_KEY plus the credential for your chosen harness (for example CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN)
docker compose -f docker-compose.example.yml --env-file .env up -d
```

The API runs on port `3013`, with interactive docs at `http://localhost:3013/docs` and an OpenAPI 3.1 spec at `http://localhost:3013/openapi.json`.

<details>
<summary><strong>Other setups</strong></summary>

- **Local API + Docker workers** — run the API on your host, workers in Docker. See [Getting Started](https://docs.agent-swarm.dev/docs/getting-started).
- **Claude Code as the lead agent** — `bunx @desplega.ai/agent-swarm connect` (or `npx @desplega.ai/agent-swarm connect`), then tell Claude Code to register as the lead.

</details>

## How It Works

```
You (Slack / GitHub / Email / CLI)
        |
   Lead Agent  ←→  MCP API Server  ←→  SQLite DB
        |
   ┌────┼────┐
Worker  Worker  Worker
(Docker containers with full dev environments)
```

1. A task arrives via Slack DM, GitHub @mention, email, or the API.
2. The lead plans and delegates subtasks to workers.
3. Workers execute in isolated Docker containers (git, Node.js, Python, etc.).
4. Progress streams to the dashboard, Slack threads, or the API.
5. Results ship back out as PRs, custom pages, issue replies, or Slack messages.
6. Session learnings are extracted and become memory for future tasks.

More detail in the [task lifecycle docs](https://docs.agent-swarm.dev/docs/concepts/task-lifecycle).

## Integrations

Missing one? Ask the swarm to build it.

## Dashboard

Real-time monitoring of agents, tasks, and inter-agent chat. The task list can be filtered by requester, including **Me** and **Unattributed**, while keeping the selection in the page URL. Session titles can be renamed inline, and agent profiles can search hundreds of Lucide icons, pick a color, and retain deterministic defaults when no customization is set. Use the hosted version at [app.agent-swarm.dev](https://app.agent-swarm.dev), or run locally:

```bash
cd apps/ui && bun install && bun run dev
```

Opens at `http://localhost:5274`.

## [CLI](https://docs.agent-swarm.dev/docs/reference/cli)

```bash
bunx @desplega.ai/agent-swarm <command>
npx @desplega.ai/agent-swarm <command>
```

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `onboard` | Set up a new swarm from scratch (Docker Compose wizard) |
| `connect` | Connect this project to an existing swarm |
| `api`     | Start the API + MCP HTTP server |
| `worker`  | Run a worker agent |
| `lead`    | Run a lead agent |
