"""Suite, sandboxed evaluator, and prompt for the ERA port's AlgoTune task.

The public runnable example lives in :mod:`examples.era.era_algotune`; the
loader, the shim and the reference-to-program transform live in
:mod:`examples.era._algotune_tasks`. This module is the boundary between them:
it materialises the task file a shard is generated from, runs a candidate
against it under the *same* Bubblewrap/Seatbelt profile the other three ERA
tasks use, and turns the timings that come back into the score FUTS ranks nodes
by.

Why this task exists next to the other three
--------------------------------------------
The three ERA tasks already here optimise **accuracy**: lower RMSE, more correct
digits. AlgoTune (`arXiv:2507.15887 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15887>`_,
`oripress/AlgoTune <https://github.com/oripress/AlgoTune>`_) optimises the other
axis, and holds accuracy fixed while doing it: a candidate must produce an
answer the task's own ``is_solution`` accepts, and is then scored on **how much
faster than the reference implementation it is**. Nothing about the search
changes -- same flat-PUCT tree, same aggregator, same sandbox, same governance
layer -- which is the point of :class:`~examples.era._era_domain.Domain`.

It is also the first ERA task here whose reference is a moving target in the
useful sense: the baseline is not a strawman someone wrote for the benchmark, it
is ``scipy.linalg.svd``, ``scipy.integrate.solve_ivp``, ``scipy.signal.upfirdn``
-- the call a working scientist already makes. A speedup over that is a claim
about the library, not about the benchmark.

What is faithful, and what is not
---------------------------------
Faithful to AlgoTune, checked against its own sources rather than its paper:

* the task files and their ``generate_problem`` / ``solve`` / ``is_solution``
  triple, and the published problem size per task (``n`` at a 100 ms reference
  time, read from upstream's ``reports/generation.json``);
* ``speedup = baseline_time / solver_time`` per instance, taken from the
  **minimum** of repeated runs (``main.py`` scores ``min_time_ms``);
* the **arithmetic mean** of the per-instance speedups as the task's score
  (``result_aggregator.py``), and the rule that a task whose solutions are not
  all valid has no speedup at all;
* the per-instance **10x** cut-off and the 60 s reference timeout
  (``benchmark.baseline_timeout``);
* the warm-up runs on the **previous instance**, not on the timed one
  (``warmup_idx = (idx - 1) % problem_count``). That is a correctness property
  as much as a fidelity one: warming on the timed problem hands a free hit to
  any solver that memoises on its input.
* the prompt is ``AlgoTuner/messages/initial_system_message.txt``, which names
  no acceleration technique. Neither does this.

**Where the measurement is made is a deliberate split.** Upstream scores with
``benchmark.eval_runs: 10`` over ``dataset.test_size: 100``; running that inside
a search would make one gate decision take minutes, so the search measures
cheaply -- it only has to *rank* candidates -- and the reported number is
re-taken at upstream's settings by :mod:`tools.algotune_rescore`.

Not faithful, and deliberately:

* **A candidate is a module-level ``solve(problem)``**, not AlgoTune's
  ``class Solver``. ERA's contract is a function per program and its gate checks
  for one; a class would be a second contract for one task.
* **The dataset is generated, not downloaded.** AlgoTune publishes 100 train and
  100 test instances per task as a HuggingFace dataset; this draws its problems
  from the same ``generate_problem`` at the same ``n``, seeded per shard, because
  a shard has to be a *disjoint* draw for the held-back split to mean anything.
* **One rewrite per node, not a ~100-turn command loop.** Upstream's agent gets
  ``edit`` / ``eval`` / ``profile`` / ``revert`` and a $1 budget. A flat tree
  search has no conversation to run those in, so what its prompt can carry is
  the *state* those commands would have produced, not the commands.
* **Timing is per evaluation, not calibrated once.** The reference is re-timed
  in the same sandboxed process, moments before the candidate. That doubles the
  work and removes the machine from the ratio.
* **Search hyper-parameters follow ERA, not AlgoTuner.** Upstream runs every
  model at ``temperature: 0.0``, which is right for one conversation and wrong
  for a tree: at zero, every draw from a given parent is the same draw and the
  search has nothing to explore with.

#: Upstream's own record of the dataset it published: for each of the 154 tasks,
#: the problem size ``n`` at which the reference took ~100 ms on the machine
#: AlgoTune generated on, and the timings that established it. Read rather than
#: re-derived, so the problem sizes here are the benchmark's rather than this
#: host's -- a size calibrated on whatever machine happens to run the search
#: would make two runs of this port incomparable.
SIZES_URL = _RAW + "/reports/generation.json"

#: The 147 AlgoTune tasks this port can run, and why it is 147 rather than 154.
#:
#: This list used to be 72, and the gap was never the benchmark -- it was this
#: port's dependency set. AlgoTune pins its own 156 packages in
#: ``requirements.txt``; installing the ones its *references* actually need, and
#: allowing what its own 2595 published solvers actually import, takes the
#: runnable set from 72 to 147. What each one was the sole blocker for, measured
#: rather than guessed: ortools 13 tasks, networkx 9, sklearn 8, pysat 2, sympy
#: 2, POT 2, faiss 2, mpmath 1, hdbscan 1.
#:
#: Two filters remain, both mechanical and both checked by
#: ``tests/test_era_algotune.py`` rather than asserted here:
#:
#: 1. **The reference must import only what this port installs and allows.**
#: 2. **The reference must lift out of its class** (see
#:    :func:`~examples.era._algotune_tasks.derive_seed_program`), so the root
#:    node is a program rather than a bound method.
#:
#: Of the seven that are out: ``aes_gcm_encryption`` and ``chacha_encryption``
#: want ``os.urandom`` (see :data:`NOT_ALLOWED_ON_PURPOSE`), two do not lift out
#: of their class, ``lqr`` is in :data:`RUNTIME_EXCLUDED`, and two more still
#: need a package this port does not carry.
#:
#: Every dependency here has to be reachable *inside* the sandbox, which means
#: ``dist-packages`` rather than the user site. Three separate packages hit that
#: trap -- OSQP wants ``jinja2``, OR-Tools wants ``dateutil``, and ``jinja2``
#: itself had been installed into ``~/.local`` -- and each failed with a message
#: about the solver rather than about the bind, which reads as a broken task.
#:
#: Tasks that clear both mechanical filters and still cannot be scored, kept
#: here rather than quietly missing from :data:`TASKS` so a rebuild of that list
#: cannot silently re-admit them. It has happened: regenerating TASKS from
#: "derives and passes the gate" put ``lqr`` straight back, because what is
#: wrong with ``lqr`` only shows up when its checker runs.

#: measured and both rejected:

#:     search told which lever to pull is not measuring what AlgoTuner measured.
#:   * A version that glossed each library -- "numba, a just-in-time compiler"
#:     -- bought nothing at all: 0/8 against the bare list's 1/8 on
#:     ``polynomial_real``, where upstream's field is bimodal at 70x-138x with
#:     numba and 1.0x without.

#: ``polynomial_real``, 30 draws: an approach that left the reference's framing

#: Upstream's `AlgoTuner/messages/initial_system_message.txt`, verbatim except
#: where this port's contract genuinely differs. Two things differ and both are
#: structural rather than editorial:
#:
#: 1. **A module-level `solve(problem)` rather than a `Solver` class.** ERA's
#:    contract is one function per program and its gate checks for one.
#: 2. **One rewrite per turn rather than the `edit`/`eval`/`revert` command
#:    loop.** A flat tree search has no conversation to run commands in, so the
#:    command block, the budget messaging and the linter/`.pyx` notes that only
#:    describe that loop are dropped rather than paraphrased.
#:
#: Everything else is upstream's wording: the 10x rule, "Compilation time of your
#: init function will not count towards your function's runtime", "Be creative
#: and optimize your approach!", and the GOALS paragraph.
#:
#: **It says nothing about how to make code fast, and that is the point.**
#: Upstream's agent is told the setting and the rules and left to it -- it
#: reaches for numba on 24% of tasks with no encouragement at all, over ~100
#: turns of watching its own edits fail. An earlier version of this file carried
#: a block naming four acceleration techniques, and a number measured against
#: that prompt is not comparable with upstream's. It is gone.
SETTING = """SETTING:
You're an autonomous programmer tasked with solving a specific problem. You are
to write a single Python function, and you will be evaluated based on the
best-performing piece of code you produce.
Apart from the default Python packages, you have access to the following
additional packages:
{packages}

YOUR TASK:
Your objective is to define a module-level function in `solver.py`:
```
def solve(problem):
    \"\"\"Your implementation goes here.\"\"\"
    ...
```

IMPORTANT: Compilation time of your init function will not count towards your
function's runtime.

This `solve` function will be the entrypoint called by the evaluation harness.
Strive to align your implementation as closely as possible with the desired
performance criteria. For each instance, your function can run for at most 10x
the reference runtime for that instance. Strive to have your implementation run
as fast as possible, while returning the same output as the reference function
(for the same given input). Be creative and optimize your approach!

**TIPS:**
Do not put an if __name__ == "__main__": block in your code, as it will not be
ran (only the solve function will).

**GOALS:**
Your primary objective is to optimize the `solve` function to run as as fast as
possible, while returning the optimal solution.
You will receive better scores the quicker your solution runs, and you will be
penalized for exceeding the time limit or returning non-optimal solutions."""
