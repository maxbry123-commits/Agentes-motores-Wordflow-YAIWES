"""Sandbox-side runner for the ERA example's candidate programs.

Executed inside Bubblewrap or Seatbelt. Standard library only, and it emits
exactly one JSON object on stdout -- the candidate's own prints are redirected
into a buffer so a chatty program cannot corrupt that object.

Unlike the OpenEvolve runner next door, the candidate here *imports third-party
scientific packages*: pandas, numpy and scikit-learn are the whole point of the
benchmark. So this runner does not pretend the AST gate is the boundary. It
raises the address-space limit to something a fitted model actually needs, and
the isolation that matters -- no network, no writes outside the scratch
directory -- comes from the sandbox profile rather than from the gate.
