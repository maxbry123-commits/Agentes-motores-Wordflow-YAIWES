    Deliberately *not* as strict as the OpenEvolve port's gate: that one allows
    six standard-library modules and this one has to allow scikit-learn, so it
    cannot claim to be the isolation boundary. What it does buy is that the
    common accidents -- a candidate that shells out, opens a file by hand, or
    reaches for a dunder -- fail in-process with a readable message instead of
    dying against a sandbox profile.

    The three keyword arguments are what a second task on this evaluator needs
    and nothing more. ``entrypoint`` names the function the candidate must
    define; ``allowed_imports`` narrows or widens the import set; and
    ``literal_top_level=False`` admits computed module-level constants -- a
    Gauss-Legendre node table built once at import is ordinary numerics, and
    refusing it would reject good programs for a rule whose real work (no
    imports outside the set, no dunders, no ``exec``) is done elsewhere. The
    cost is bounded by the sandbox: module-level work runs under the same CPU
    limit as everything else the candidate does.

    ``allow_top_level_calls=True`` admits a bare call as a statement, which is
    how a JIT is warmed: ``_kernel(0.0, 0.0)`` after an ``@njit`` definition
    forces compilation at import instead of inside the first timed call. It
    grants no capability the flag above does not already grant -- ``TABLE =
    build()`` is the same call with its result bound -- so refusing it was
    friction rather than a boundary. Off by default all the same, because a port

{description}

Here is a preview of the training data:
{preview}

The goal is to predict '{TARGET_COLUMN}'. The metric is RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).
Lower is better.

The previous solution had a score (RMSE) of: {shown}
Previous Solution Code:
```python
{parent.code}
```

Please generate a NEW, IMPROVED Python function named `train_and_predict` that:
1. Accepts `train_path` and `test_path` as strings.
2. Trains a regression model.
3. Returns the predictions for the test set as a numpy array or list.
4. You can use pandas, numpy, scikit-learn.

IMPORTANT: DO NOT use `xgboost` or `lightgbm`.

Your code must look like this:
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
# ... other imports

def train_and_predict(train_path, test_path):
    # Load data
    train = pd.read_csv(train_path)
    test = pd.read_csv(test_path)

    # ... Feature Engineering ...
    # ... Training ...

    # Predict
    predictions = ...
    return predictions
```
Provide the full, runnable code including imports.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS FOR SPEED:
1. DO NOT use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
2. If using RandomForest or Boosting, set `n_estimators` to maximum 50.
3. Keep the model lightweight (execution time limit is {timeout:.0f} seconds).
4. The sandbox has no network access and one CPU thread; do not download data
   or set `n_jobs` above 1.
