"""Suite, sandboxed evaluator, and prompt for the ERA LLM-SRBench task.

The public runnable example lives in :mod:`examples.era.era_llm_srbench`; the
answer format and the metrics live in :mod:`examples.era._era_srbench_expr`.
This module is the boundary between them: it downloads the benchmark, deals its
problems into shards, runs a candidate against one shard under the *same*
Bubblewrap/Seatbelt profile the other three ERA tasks use, and turns the
equations that come back into the score FUTS ranks nodes by.

What a candidate is here
------------------------
Not an equation -- a **method for finding equations**. The tree search writes
one program, and that program is asked to discover the governing equation of
every problem in a shard, each from its own training samples and its own
one-paragraph description. So the thing being optimised is a symbolic-regression
procedure, in the same sense that the integrals task optimises a quadrature rule
rather than the value of any particular integral.

That is a *different experiment* from the one LLM-SRBench's own leaderboard
runs. There, an LLM proposes hypotheses for one problem at a time, with the
data in its context, and a per-problem budget of samples. Here the model never
sees a data point: it writes the searcher, the searcher runs sandboxed against
all of them, and the score comes back. The benchmark, the splits and the metrics
are the benchmark's; the protocol is ERA's. A number produced here belongs
beside the paper's tables with that said out loud, which
``docs/algo-era.md`` does and every result file repeats.

Where the data comes from
-------------------------
The benchmark's own release (``nnheui/llm-srbench``) is a **gated** HuggingFace
dataset: the parquet metadata and the 239 MB ``lsr_bench_data.hdf5`` of samples
both 401 without a token, so a port that reached for them would work only for
whoever had already clicked through the gate. ``pkuHaowei/llm-srbench`` is an
ungated re-upload of the same benchmark with the samples inlined into parquet,
and that is what this module fetches. It is a third party's copy, so it is
checked rather than trusted: ``tests/test_era_srbench.py`` re-evaluates every
ground-truth expression that is evaluable as written against the samples shipped
beside it, which pins the data to the equations the paper published.

Two things in that copy's metadata do not survive the check, and neither one
touches scoring, which is numeric throughout:

* the 36 ``chem_react`` ground truths carry a mangled parameter (a constant
  followed by ``_z``/``_w``/``_s``), so they do not parse;
* the 44 ``phys_osc`` ground truths are symbolic templates -- ``F0``, ``beta``,
  ``omega0`` appear with no values attached -- so they do not evaluate.

The remaining 49 synthetic problems and all 111 transformed Feynman problems do
evaluate, and they reproduce their own samples. Ground-truth expressions are
carried into the result file as metadata for exactly that reason: they are what
a reader checks the benchmark with, not what a run is scored against.

Please generate a NEW, IMPROVED Python function named `discover` that:
1. Has the signature `discover(x, y, spec)` and returns {shape}.
2. `x` is a float64 numpy array of shape (n_samples, n_inputs) whose columns are
   `spec["input_vars"]` in order, and `y` is a float64 array of shape
   (n_samples,). `spec` also holds `output_var`, `description`, `seconds`,
   `answer_format`, `max_params` and `evaluate`.

4. **Proposes a structure that the science points to.** A rate law, an
   oscillator, a growth model, a rearranged physical identity -- write that form
   and check it with `spec["evaluate"](answer, x)`, which is the grader's own
   code and treats constants exactly the way the grader will. Try another form if
   it is poor, and keep the best.
5. Is allowed to be specific to THIS dataset. There is only one, and its
   description is above; a form chosen because it fits this science is the

   interrupted and scores zero. Budget the fit and keep the best form so far.
2. These are the only imports a static gate accepts, and a refused program scores
   nothing at all: {imports}. `eval`, `exec`, `compile` and `sympy` are refused
   too. There is no network and no filesystem, and do not set any thread count
   above 1.
3. Seed every random number generator you use, from a constant.
4. A short equation that generalises beats a long one that interpolates. The

Please generate a NEW, IMPROVED Python function named `discover` that:
1. Has the signature `discover(x, y, spec)` and returns a STRING.
2. `x` is a float64 numpy array of shape (n_samples, n_inputs), `y` is a float64
   numpy array of shape (n_samples,). `spec` is a dict with `input_vars` (the
   column names of `x`, in order), `output_var`, `description` (the problem's own
   natural-language statement, which names the science), `seconds`, and
   `evaluate`.
3. Returns the discovered equation as an expression in the names in
   `spec["input_vars"]` -- for example `"1.7*P - 0.02*P**2 + sin(t)"`. It is
   parsed, not executed: the only things allowed in it are numeric constants,
   those variable names, `pi`, `e`, the operators + - * / **, and these
   functions: {allowed}. Anything else -- a comparison, an index, an unknown
   name -- is rejected and that problem scores zero.
4. Scores its own candidate forms with `spec["evaluate"](expression, data)`,
   which is the grader's own parser: it takes an expression string and a
   (n, n_inputs) array in `input_vars` order, returns a length-n float64 array,
   and raises ValueError on anything the grammar in (3) does not accept. Use it
   rather than building the expression twice -- what it accepts is exactly what
   your answer is allowed to be. `eval`, `exec` and `compile` are rejected
   before your program ever runs.
5. Fits the numeric constants of whatever form it proposes. An equation with the
   right shape and untuned constants scores near zero here.
6. Is one method that works across every domain above, not a dispatch on the
   problem id. Reading `spec["description"]` to bias the search towards forms
   that are plausible for that science is exactly the point; hard-coding an
   answer for a particular problem is not.

Your code must look like this:
```python
import numpy as np
# ... other imports

def discover(x, y, spec):
    # ... propose candidate forms, fit their constants, keep the best ...
    values = spec["evaluate"]("1.7*P - 0.02*P**2", x)   # score a form
    return "..."
```
Provide the full, runnable code including imports.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
1. {problem_seconds:.0f} seconds of wall-clock per problem, {timeout:.0f} seconds
   for the whole problem set. A problem that overruns is interrupted and scores
   zero, so budget your search and keep the best answer found so far.
2. These are the only imports a static gate accepts, and a refused program
   scores nothing at all: {imports}. `eval`, `exec`, `compile` and `sympy` are
   refused too -- build candidate models as closures, or evaluate them with
   `spec["evaluate"]`. There is no network and no filesystem; do not read or
   write files, and do not set any thread count above 1.
3. Seed every random number generator you use, from a constant. Two runs of this
   program on the same data must return the same equation.
4. Guard against overfitting: a long equation that fits the training samples and
   misses the held-out ones scores worse than a short one that generalises. Hold
   part of the training data back for your own selection.
