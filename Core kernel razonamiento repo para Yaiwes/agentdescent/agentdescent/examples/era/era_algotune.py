"""ERA tree search on AlgoTune -- one tree per task, scored in speedup.

    "How good are language models at coming up with new algorithms? To try to
    answer this, we built a benchmark, AlgoTune, comprised of 154 widely used
    math, physics, and computer science functions. For each function, the goal
    is to write code that produces the same outputs as the original function,
    while being faster."
    -- AlgoTune, arXiv:2507.15887

What the search optimises
-------------------------
A candidate is a single function, ``solve(problem)``, and it is scored by
**how much faster than the task's reference implementation it is** on problems
the task's own ``is_solution`` accepts. The reference is not a strawman: it is
``scipy.linalg.eig``, ``scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`` on an LSODA-class stiff
solver, ``scipy.signal.upfirdn``, ``scipy.spatial.Delaunay`` -- the call a
working scientist already makes. The root node of every tree *is* that
reference, lifted out of its class into a runnable program, so the tree starts
at exactly 1.0x and every gain is measured against the library.

Correctness is not part of the score, it is a precondition of having one: a
solution the checker rejects scores nothing at all, however fast it was. That is
AlgoTune's rule and it is what stops the search from discovering that the fastest
way to compute an SVD is to not compute it.

One tree per task
-----------------
Each task gets its own flat-PUCT tree, its own root, its own held-back shards
and its own result. They are separate searches over separate program spaces --
a factorisation trick found for ``qr_factorization`` is not a node in
``ode_stiff_vanderpol``'s tree and could not be selected there -- so running
them as one tree would be an averaging artefact rather than a search. The
run reports each task's own speedup and, across tasks, the **geometric** mean,
which is what a ratio of times has to be averaged with.

Everything about the search itself is `era_empirical_software.py`: the flat-PUCT
tree, the visit reservation, the staleness handling, the aggregator, the
governance layer. This module supplies a
:class:`~examples.era._era_domain.Domain` per task -- seed program, sandboxed
evaluator, mutation prompt, metric name -- and the command line the other ports
share.
