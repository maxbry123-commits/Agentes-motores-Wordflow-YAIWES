"""Skill self-evolution, faithful port: **GEPA — Reflective Prompt Evolution**.

Paper : "GEPA: Reflective Prompt Evolution Can Outperform Reinforcement
        Learning", Lakshya A. Agrawal et al., 2025 (arXiv:2507.19457).
Repo  : https://github.com/gepa-ai/gepa  (also `dspy.GEPA`)
Dataset: **HotpotQA** (multi-hop QA, distractor setting), exact-match --
        one of GEPA's four adaptation benchmarks.

GEPA evolves the *instruction prompt* of a compound AI system with a genetic,
reflective loop. Its two distinctive mechanisms are both preserved here:

1. **Reflective mutation** (Algorithm 1 `UpdatePrompt`). On a failure the LLM
   reflects on the execution trace **and the natural-language evaluation
   feedback** (`mu_f`: the predicted vs. gold answer), then writes a *new*
   instruction. This is the `gepa_agent` propose step below.

2. **Pareto-based candidate selection** (Algorithm 2) -- the reason GEPA beats
   greedy hill-climbing. Instead of always mutating the single best-*average*
   candidate (which gets stuck in local optima), GEPA keeps a **pool** of
   candidates scored on every `D_pareto` instance and samples the next parent
   from the **per-instance Pareto frontier**, weighted by how many instances a
   candidate uniquely wins. This is `pareto_select` + `ParetoAggregator`, wired
   into `evolve()` through the `aggregator_factory=` hook -- the sanctioned way
   to *swap the whole optimizer*. The aggregator sets the dev head to the
   sampled parent, so `evolve()`'s next round mutates *it*, not the greedy best.

Only the parent-selection optimizer changes; the ledger, governance, staleness,
and statistical-acceptance machinery are the framework's. Prompt = L2 skill ->
`blast_radius=0.2`.

    python -m examples.gepa.gepa_prompt_evolution --dry-run           # plan only, zero network
    python -m examples.gepa.gepa_prompt_evolution --model claude-haiku-4-5
    python -m examples.gepa.gepa_prompt_evolution --rounds 10 --workers 3

Faithful-but-tractable simplifications (documented): GEPA optimises a
multi-module compound system with a rollout budget; here the system is a single
instruction module and the minibatch is the per-round worker sample (raise
`--workers` for a bigger minibatch). The Pareto set is the held-out split.
