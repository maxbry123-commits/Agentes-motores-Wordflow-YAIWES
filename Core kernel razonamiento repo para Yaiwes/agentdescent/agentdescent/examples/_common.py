"""The command-line contract shared by the faithful algorithm ports.

Algorithm-specific vocabulary stays in each port. In particular, iteration
flags such as ``--rounds``, ``--generations``, ``--iterations``, and ``--steps``
must not be normalised here: they are part of the upstream algorithm's language.

Declaring a flag in one place is only half of a contract -- the code that
*honours* it has to live here too, or a port can grow a ``--yes`` it never reads
and every test still passes. So the behaviours behind the shared flags are
functions, not prose: ``confirm`` for ``--yes``, ``completion_for`` for
``--provider``/``--model``, ``worker_count`` for ``--serial``, and the early
``--dry-run`` return that each port's ``main`` performs before touching data.

``score_tasks`` is here for the same reason: every port had written the same
sequential held-out loop, and every port paid the same silent wall-clock for it.

    workload.

    ``async_ratio_default`` is caller-owned for the same reason: the lag budget
    counts *artifact versions*, so how much wall-clock it buys depends entirely
    on how long the caller's rollout takes. Three is sensible when a rollout is
    a model call taking seconds; :mod:`examples._method_runner` sets one,
    because that is the value every row in ``bench/results/`` was measured at.

    Chasing a 20-task test split by raising the fetch buys a 20-task gate nobody
