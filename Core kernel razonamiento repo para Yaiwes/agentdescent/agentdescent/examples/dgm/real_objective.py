"""A real objective for the DGM port: a self-editing agent, run against pytest.

The shipped objective is a *surrogate* -- each SWE instance is assigned a latent
capability set by hashing its id, and an agent "resolves" it when its own
capability set covers that. The DGM loop is faithful on top of it, but the
objective it optimises has three properties the real one does not:

* it is **monotone** -- adding a capability can never un-resolve a task, so a
  self-modification can never regress;
* capabilities never **interact** -- no edit can help one task and break another;
* the required set is a **hash**, unrelated to the task's actual difficulty.

Monotonicity is the one that matters, because it removes the reason DGM keeps an
archive at all. Open-ended search retains stepping stones because a worse
intermediate can lead somewhere better; under a monotone objective there are no
worse intermediates, and `keep-all` plus the novelty-discounted parent draw are
machinery with nothing to do.

So this module replaces the objective rather than the algorithm. The agent is a
**real directory of Python source** that edits itself; a task is a **real
package with a failing pytest**; a score is what pytest actually reports. Every
DGM mechanism above it -- keep-all archive, `sigmoid(10*(s-0.5)) / (1+children)`
parent selection, staged small->medium escalation -- is untouched.

**This is not SWE-bench.** Six vendored bugs in `examples/dgm/tasks/` are not 500
real repository issues, and a number from here cannot be compared with the paper.
What it does reproduce is the *shape*: real code, real execution, real pass/fail,
and self-edits that can genuinely make the agent worse -- including edits that
leave it unable to run at all.
