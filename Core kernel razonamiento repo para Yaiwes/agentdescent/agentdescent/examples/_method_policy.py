"""The declarative contract between a candidate method and the runner.

A method is a :class:`MethodPolicy`: an artifact representation (``strategy``),
frozen datasets, pure ``solve``/``propose``/``reward`` functions, and the engine
decision-plane seams its mechanism plugs into (``engine=Policies(...)``). The
definition never sees the recorder, phase strings, modes, budgets, or
thresholds -- :mod:`examples._method_runner` owns all of that, for the same
reason ``agentdescent/policies.py`` gives for the engine: the algorithm is not
allowed to know about the execution plane.

Validation lives in exactly one place: the strategy's ``to_diff``. ``propose``
returns the model's raw text (or ``None``); an unparseable proposal costs its
share of the candidate budget, increments ``invalid_proposals``, and produces no
diff. No fallback substitution happens anywhere.

The shared strategies here all hold **plain-text values per key**, which is what
makes :class:`~agentdescent.fusion.ReflectiveFusion` safe to install on top:
disjoint keys union without any model call, and contested keys are merged as
text. Strategies whose values are code or strict JSON opt out via
``MethodPolicy(reflective=False)``.
