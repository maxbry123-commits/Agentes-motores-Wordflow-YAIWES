"""Run the equal-budget arms on a real dataset and print the table.

    python -m bench.baselines_run --dataset hotpotqa --budget-rollouts 96 \
        --width 4 --seeds 0,1,2 --provider openai --model GLM-5.2 --yes

Three arms -- `serial`, `best_of_n_fork`, `merge_of_n` -- over one
:class:`~agentdescent.baselines.Workload`, so only the execution shape varies.
See `agentdescent/baselines.py` for why this exists: every efficiency number in
this repository is a throughput speedup, and throughput cannot distinguish
merging from sampling-and-selecting because fork-and-select is parallel too.

**The default aggregator, deliberately.** The datasets come from the GEPA and ACE
ports, but their custom optimizers do not: GEPA's Pareto selection and ACE's
grow-and-refine are *search* strategies, and running them here would leave the
comparison unable to say whether a difference came from merging or from the
search. The thing under test is the merge, so the merge is the only thing that
changes. That also means the numbers here are not comparable with those ports'
own results, and are not meant to be.

**The third split.** `evolve()` optimises against its own held-out split and stops
when that split says so, and the fork arm *selects* on it -- so reporting it
would be reporting a training score twice over. `test_eval` scores `ds.test`,
which no gate in any arm ever sees.

Cost is the reason the defaults are small. Three arms x three seeds is nine runs,
and the fork arm is N runs by itself, so `--width 4 --seeds 0,1,2` is 33 runs of
`--budget-rollouts` rollouts each. Print `--plan` first.
