## The algorithm

FUTS is 155 lines upstream and the whole of it is one loop:

1. **Rank.** Sort every node by score; `rank_score = rank / (N − 1)`, so the
   worst node is 0 and the best is 1. A lone node is 0.5.
2. **Score.** `puct = rank_score + c_puct · (1/N) · √(Σvisits) / (1 + visits)`.
3. **Select.** `argmax(puct)` over **all** nodes — there is no descent from the
   root, which is what "flat" names.
4. **Expand.** The model rewrites the selected node's program; the sandbox runs
   it; the resulting score makes a new node whose parent is the selected one.
5. **Backpropagate.** The new node and every ancestor take one visit.

Two choices in there are doing the work, and both differ from ordinary UCT:

**Exploitation is a rank, not a value.** Scores enter the formula only through
their order, so the exploration constant means the same thing whether the metric
is RMSE, log-likelihood or accuracy — and one bad candidate scoring `-inf`
cannot swamp the term the way a raw value would.

**The prior is uniform.** AlphaZero's `P(s, a)` needs a policy network to say
which sibling is promising. There is none here, so `P = 1/N` and the exploration
term reduces to a visit-starvation bonus.

## Algorithm mapping

| ERA mechanism | AgentDescent representation |
|---|---|
| `futs.search`'s select step | [`selection.FlatPuct`](selection.md), a shipped `SelectionPolicy` |
| `futs.Node` list | `EraTree`, the aggregator's shared archive |
| `futs.Solution` (a program string) | `Task` rollouts over a source-code artifact |
| `PlaygroundGenerator.__call__` | `propose(rendered, task, output, reward)` |
| Full program replacement | `EraStrategy.to_diff()` |
| `PlaygroundExecutor.__call__` | `run()` plus `reward_program()` |
| `Sandbox.run` (upstream: `NotImplementedError`) | `_era_support.sandbox_command` — Bubblewrap / Seatbelt |
| `num_iterations` | `evolve(rounds=iterations // workers)`, `--budget-rollouts` |
| Concurrent expansions | `evolve(max_concurrency=...)` |
| Completion-order commits | `async_evolve(async_ratio=...)` |
| Best node so far | AgentDescent `Ledger` dev head |

The artifact is generated executable code, so the port declares
`blast_radius=0.6` and is classified as an L1 change. The RMSE evaluator remains
the acceptance authority, as it is upstream.

## How it plugs into `evolve()`

```python
result = evolve(
    build_tasks(shards),               # one task per held-out shard
    reward_program,                    # 1 / (1 + RMSE), from the runner payload
    run=make_run(...),                 # train in the sandbox, predict one shard
    propose=make_propose(tree, ...),   # FUTS select -> mutation prompt -> program
    strategy=EraStrategy(),            # the program is the artifact
    aggregator_factory=factory,        # EraTreeAggregator: execute, append, commit
    blast_radius=0.6,
    rounds=iterations // workers,      # total expansions fixed as workers vary
)
```

Four plug-ins, and one thing deliberately *not* reused:

* **`strategy=EraStrategy`** — a single-slot program artifact. Not `SingleSlot`,
  because `to_diff` has to carry the parent's tree index alongside the code:
  where a node attaches is part of the algorithm, not metadata.
* **`aggregator_factory=`** — `EraTreeAggregator` owns the tree. It re-executes
  every surviving card against the held-out shards, appends the node, and commits
  the best-scoring program to the `dev` head.
* **`selection.FlatPuct`** — the shipped policy, called by the tree under its own
  lock so the visit reservation and the pick are one atomic step.
* **`reward_program`** is custom rather than one of
  [`agentdescent.rewards`](rewards.md): those score a *text answer* against a
  gold string, and this scores a vector of predictions against a vector of
  truths. Reaching for `numeric_close` here would have meant scoring the
  candidate's printed output rather than its predictions.

## Fidelity and boundaries

Preserved mechanics:

1. The PUCT formula, `c_puct = 1.0`, the rank normalisation including the
   single-node 0.5 case, the uniform prior, and visits backpropagated up the
   parent chain. Pinned by
   `tests/test_era_example.py::test_rank_scores_match_the_upstream_unit_test`
   and `::test_puct_matches_the_upstream_unit_test`, which are upstream's own
   `futs_test.py` fixtures.
2. **A node is appended for every expansion, including a failed one.** Upstream
   returns `float('-inf')` from `PlaygroundExecutor` when the sandbox fails and
   appends the node anyway; dropping it would change the rank denominator and
   the prior on every later iteration.
3. The task: Playground S3E1, the 80/20 head/tail split of `train.csv`, the
   `MedHouseVal` target dropped from what the candidate reads,
   `train_and_predict(train_path, test_path)`, RMSE scored on the host, and the
   mutation prompt — including the ban on `xgboost`/`lightgbm` and the three
   speed constraints.
4. `score = -RMSE`, because FUTS maximises. The engine's `[0, 1]` reward is
   `1 / (1 + RMSE)`, which is strictly decreasing in RMSE and therefore induces
   *exactly* the ranking `-RMSE` does — the tree and the acceptance gate cannot
   disagree about which of two programs is better.

Intentional differences:

1. **Upstream ships no sandbox.** `implementation/sandbox.py` is an abstract
   class whose `run` raises `NotImplementedError("Must provide a sandbox for
   executing untrusted code.")`. This port supplies one and refuses to run
   without it. See the boundary note below — it is the most important thing on
   this page.
2. Upstream reports one RMSE over its whole 20% tail, which is also the split it
   optimised against. Here the tail is cut into equal contiguous shards; the
   first `--shards` are what the search can score and the last `--test-shards`
   are never shown to it, so the reported number is on unseen rows.
3. A shard is one AgentDescent task, so `run()` trains the current program and
   predicts one shard. Upstream has a single train-and-predict per candidate;
   this makes the same candidate measurable per-task, which is what the engine's
   held-out gate and `eval_concurrency` need.
4. Upstream is serial. With N workers a visit is reserved at **selection** time
   rather than after execution — see below.
5. Candidate threads are pinned to one (`OMP_NUM_THREADS=1` and friends), because
   `RLIMIT_CPU` counts CPU seconds across threads: an OpenBLAS that helpfully
   starts eight would burn a 60-second budget in eight wall-clock seconds and the
   candidate would be killed for being fast. Upstream sets no thread policy and
   has no CPU limit to protect.

### The visit reservation, and why it is not a semantics change

Upstream backpropagates the new node's visit *after* `execute_fn` returns. This
port increments the selected node and its ancestors at *selection*, and gives
the inserted node `num_visits = 1` without re-walking the chain.

With one proposal in flight, nothing can observe the tree between those two
points, so every selection sees identical visit counts — the two are the same
algorithm. `tests/test_era_example.py::test_serial_tree_reproduces_upstream_futs`
pins that: it drives this port's tree and a line-by-line transcription of
`futs.search` with the same mock generator and executor, and asserts the same
node is expanded at every step, with the same final visit vector.

With N in flight it is the standard parallel-MCTS virtual loss, and it is the
minimum needed for N workers to mean anything: without it, `argmax(puct)` is
deterministic and every worker in a batch would be handed the same parent.

!!! danger "The AST gate is not the boundary here, and must not be read as one"
    The OpenEvolve port's gate allows six standard-library modules, so the gate
    and the sandbox are two real layers. This benchmark *requires*
    `pandas`, `numpy` and `scikit-learn` — a stack that can read files and spawn
    processes — so admitting it admits most of what a gate would otherwise stop.

    What the gate still buys is that the ordinary accidents (a candidate that
    shells out, calls `open`, or reaches for a dunder) fail in-process with a
    readable message. What actually confines a candidate is the sandbox:
    **Bubblewrap** (`bwrap`) on Linux, **Seatbelt** (`sandbox-exec`) on macOS,
    both denying network access and confining writes to a scratch directory,
    with CPU / address-space / file-size / fd / process limits from `setrlimit`
    inside the runner. A host with neither backend raises rather than running
    model-written code unconfined.

    Unlike the OpenEvolve port, the Bubblewrap profile here binds the root
    **read-only** rather than a handful of directories: the candidate's imports
    live wherever the interpreter was installed, and enumerating those would be
    a guess that fails differently on every host. Reads are therefore open on
    both platforms; writes and the network are not. That is a weaker boundary
    than OpenEvolve's and it is stated rather than glossed.

    It is checked against the kernel rather than by reading the profile back:
    `test_the_sandbox_blocks_the_writes_and_network_it_claims_to_block` runs a
    probe under the real profile and asserts a write outside the scratch
    directory fails, a write inside it succeeds, and `socket.create_connection`
    cannot reach the network.

## The second task — numerical solution of integrals

The ERA abstract lists six demonstrations. Five are scored against a leaderboard
or a held-out dataset; the sixth is not:

> "ERA also produced expert-level software for geospatial analysis, neural
> activity prediction in zebrafish, and **numerical solution of integrals**"

Upstream released `futs.py` and one task, `playground_s3e1.py`; there is no
integrals implementation to port. So what is faithful here is the **search** —
and the nine-family suite below is this repository's construction, stated as
such wherever it is reported. It lives in
[`examples/era/era_hard_integrals.py`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/examples/era/era_hard_integrals.py),
and it runs on **the same search**: same flat-PUCT tree, same visit reservation,
same aggregator, same governance layer, same sandbox profile. The seam is a
[`Domain`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/examples/era/_era_domain.py)
— seed program, sandboxed evaluator, mutation prompt, metric name — and nothing
algorithmic lives in it. `domain=None` is upstream's Kaggle task, so a caller
who names no domain gets the port upstream ships.

### What the candidate is asked for

```python
def integrate(f, a, b):     # a may be -inf, b may be +inf
    ...                     # -> one float
```

`f` is a **black box**: a scalar function of one float, with no formula, no
parameters and no family name attached. Nine integrals make a problem set, one
from each of nine difficulty classes:

| Class | What it breaks |
|---|---|
| algebraic singularities at **both** endpoints | boundedness, twice |
| logarithmic singularity of integer power | boundedness, and every derivative |
| oscillation accumulating at an endpoint | any fixed node count near the corner |
| interior peak of width 1e-7 to 1e-4 | adaptive subdivision that never samples it |
| barely damped oscillation on `[0, inf)` | tail truncation |
| oscillation that **never** decays on `[0, inf)` | tail truncation, harder |
| endpoint singularity × fast oscillation, damped | both at once |
| cancellation over `(-inf, inf)` | relative accuracy, by 4 orders of magnitude |
| endpoint singularity **and** a heavy tail | one substitution cannot fix both |

### Why the score means something

**The reference is a closed form, not another integrator.** Every family has an
exact value in terms of `Γ`, `atan`, `π/sin(πs)` and friends, so a candidate is
scored against arithmetic rather than against a rival method it might legitimately
beat. `tests/test_era_integrals.py::test_the_closed_form_matches_high_precision_quadrature`
checks each identity against mpmath at 30 digits — through a per-family
substitution, because mpmath's own quadrature on the raw integrand disagrees
with the closed form in the third decimal place on the Fresnel family. That
disagreement is the benchmark working.

**The metric is correct significant digits**, `min(12, -log10(relative error))`,
averaged over the problem set. The cap is the precision of the references
themselves: reporting 15 digits against a `math`-library reference would be
measuring the reference's rounding. A problem that raises, returns `nan` or
overruns its budget scores 0 and the rest of the set still counts — a quadrature
suite is nine independent facts, and partial credit is what makes the tree's
ranking informative.

**Every problem has a hard cap on calls to the integrand** (200,000 by default,
enforced in the runner, not trusted to the candidate). Without it the best
program is whichever one is allowed to spend the most, which is not a question
about method. `quad` on defaults uses ~1,000.

**The family is never named to the model.** The prompt describes the *classes*,
which is the task description an expert would be handed; the candidate sees a
callable and two limits; and the failure report the search feeds back carries the
interval and the digit count but not the family. Problems are shuffled within a
shard, so position is not family either. Together those are what keep the task
"write a quadrature rule" rather than "write a dispatch table".

### Alignment with the benchmark, item by item

Checked against the benchmark's own code (`bench/pipelines.py`,
`bench/datamodules.py`, `methods/llmsr/searcher.py`) and against the paper's §3,
rather than against memory of them.

**Aligned.**

* **The problems** are all 240 as released, with the paper-versus-data count
  discrepancy recorded above rather than smoothed over.
* **The splits** are the published ones — `train` / `id_test` / `ood_test`,
  taken verbatim — and no expansion is ever scored against a test split.
* **The column convention.** Upstream reads `samples[:, 0]` as the output and
  `samples[:, 1:]` as the inputs in `symbols[1:]` order. The mirror splits these
  into named arrays, and `output_vars + input_vars == symbols` holds on every
  subset checked, so the variable a name refers to is the variable upstream
  means. The ground-truth reproduction test is the second, independent check on
  the same thing.
* **NMSE** is upstream's number. It computes `np.mean((y - ŷ)**2) / np.var(y)`;
  this computes `Σ(ŷ-y)² / Σ(y-ȳ)²`. Those are the same quantity.
* **Acc(0.1)** is the paper's `1(max_i |(ŷ_i - y_i)/y_i| ≤ 0.1)`. Upstream's
  released code does not compute it at all — its pipeline logs mse, nmse, r2,
  kendall-tau and mape — so the paper's formula is the only source, and it is
  transcribed rather than reinvented.
* **The ground truth** is never read by the search or by scoring.

**Deviations, with the direction each one pushes.** Most make this harder than
the benchmark's own setup; two do not, and those are the ones to watch.

Two of the rows below were **closed** after this audit, and both are now flags
rather than differences: `--answer-format program` accepts what upstream accepts
and fits constants the way upstream fits them, and
`python -m tools.score_symbolic_accuracy` scores the paper's third metric. The
table records where each setting stands.

| | Benchmark / LLM-SR | Here | Direction |
|---|---|---|---|
| what an answer may be | arbitrary Python in the `equation()` body — `np.where`, branches, loops | `--answer-format program`: **the same**. `expression` (the default): a restricted grammar | **aligned, or harder** |
| who fits the constants | the harness, one `minimize(..., 'BFGS')` from `[1.0]*10` | `program`: **the same call**. `expression`: the candidate | **aligned, or easier** |
| how many constants an answer may have | `MAX_NPARAMS = 10` | `program`: **the same cap**. `expression`: no cap | **aligned, or easier** |
| what the search is selected on | MSE on the **full training set** (`searcher.py`) | NMSE on a 25% validation split carved out of train | **harder here** |
| rows available to fit | all of train | 75% of train (the rest is the validation pool) | **harder here** |
| LSR-Transform training rows | all 80 000 | `--train-points 4000` | **harder here** |
| a non-finite prediction | dropped, the rest scored | fails the problem; both numbers reported | **harder here** |
| budget per problem | 1 000 samples (~250 prompts) | 24 expansions (~16 model calls) | **harder here** |
| **the root node** | a fitted linear model in the raw inputs | `--seed-program linear`: **the same skeleton, verbatim**. `library`: sparse regression over a nonlinear basis | **aligned, or easier** |
| NMSE aggregation | the paper does not state mean or median | median, stated, with per-problem values in the result files | unknown |
| symbolic accuracy | a GPT-4o judge, the paper's third metric | `tools/score_symbolic_accuracy.py`, **a different judge** | **aligned in method, not in judge** |

**The fully aligned setting is `--answer-format program --seed-program linear`**:
upstream's skeleton as the root, upstream's answer format, upstream's ten
constants, upstream's optimiser. Everything else about it is still harder than
the benchmark's own setup — the selection split, the fitting rows, the budget —
so a number from it is a floor rather than a like-for-like.

Two things decide how any other number here should be read. `expression` format
leaves both the constant count and the optimiser unbounded, so a long
interpolating fit can score well under it and a number from that setting is not
comparable to the paper's; and symbolic accuracy now has a scorer but not the
paper's judge, so it is reported beside the paper's column rather than in it.

#### The ten-constant cap is what closes the interpolation hole

Aligning the answer format does not only change what is *allowed* — it changes
what the strong root can do. In `expression` format the library root emits a
nine-to-eleven term fit with a free coefficient on every term. In `program`
format the same root has to hand its terms back with `params[i]` holes, and
there are only ten, fitted once by a gradient-based BFGS from all ones. On a
fixture where the truth is `2*a*sin(b) + 3`, the library root scores 0.88 digits
in program format against a hand-written correct program's 12.0. Upstream's
`MAX_NPARAMS = 10` is not decoration: it is the thing that stops an answer from
interpolating its way past the metric.

### Deviations this task adds

1. **The gate is loosened in one place and narrowed in another.**
   `literal_top_level=False` admits computed module-level constants, because a
   Gauss-Legendre node table built once at import is ordinary numerics; the
   import allowlist drops `pandas`/`scikit-learn` and adds `cmath`. The sandbox
   is the boundary either way, and module-level work runs under the same CPU
   limit as everything else.
2. **The problem file is copied into the sandbox scratch** before the runner is
   started. The Bubblewrap profile mounts a fresh tmpfs over `/tmp`, so a suite
   living there would be invisible inside the sandbox and the candidate would be
   blamed for a `FileNotFoundError`.
3. **The problems are drawn, not downloaded.** A shard is a seeded draw from the
   catalogue, reproducible from `--seed` alone, written once under the
   dataloader cache. There is no dataset to fetch and no network in the loop.
4. `score = mean digits` with no sign flip — FUTS maximises and more digits is
   better — and the engine's `[0, 1]` reward is `mean_digits / 12`, which is
   again exactly order-preserving with what the tree ranks on.

## The third task — 2F1, and what replaces a leaderboard

The two tasks above are scored against a dataset and against arithmetic. The
third is scored against **an independent arbitrary-precision computation**, and
it exists to answer a specific objection: *a benchmark nobody else has run
proves nothing, because the people who built it also set the bar.*

[`examples/era/era_hypergeometric.py`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/examples/era/era_hypergeometric.py)
asks for a double-precision routine `hyp2f1(a, b, c, z)` — the Gauss
hypergeometric function, real parameters, over a wide declared range. Three
properties are what a leaderboard would otherwise have supplied.

**The problem is hard, and not on this repository's say-so.** The standard
survey — Pearson, Olver & Porter, *Numerical methods for the computation of the
confluent and Gauss hypergeometric functions*, Numerical Algorithms 74:821–866
(2017) — exists because no single method covers the parameter space: the Taylor
series diverges outside the unit disc and cancels well inside it, every
transformation has a bad region of its own, and the recurrences are unstable in
one direction.

**The baseline is the state of the practice, not a strawman.**
`scipy.special.hyp2f1` — Cephes underneath, in production for decades, the
function a working scientist already calls. On the declared distribution it
**loses more than six digits on roughly a third of points**, and some of those
land at zero correct digits. That is measured in
`tests/test_era_hyp2f1.py::test_the_baseline_is_not_a_strawman_and_not_perfect_either`,
which also fails if SciPy ever gets good enough that the numbers here need
restating.

**The reference cannot be argued with.** Every value comes from mpmath, which
shares no code with SciPy and none with any candidate, computed at **30 and at
60 decimal digits**, and kept only where the two agree to 25. Nothing in the
sandbox can reach it — the file a candidate's shard is built from carries four
parameters per point and no values. And the whole set is committed, so the
claim is checkable rather than reported:

```bash
python -m tools.gen_hyp2f1_stress --check   # redraws and demands the file back
```

Two tests hold that down: one re-derives every stored value from mpmath at 60
digits, the other reruns the generator and requires the committed file **byte
for byte**, which is what rules out points having been chosen after seeing how
an implementation did on them. The distribution — `a, b, c ~ U(-30, 30)`,
`z ~ U(-40, 0.999)` — was fixed before anything was measured and is recorded in
the data file beside the values.

### The one constraint that keeps the comparison honest

`mpmath`, `decimal` and `fractions` are **off this task's import allowlist**.
The deliverable is a float64 routine, comparable with SciPy's; a candidate that
reimplemented arbitrary-precision arithmetic would be answering a different
question and would be scored against a reference produced the same way it was.
`tests/test_era_hyp2f1.py` asserts each of those imports is refused by the gate.

Everything else in `scipy.special` — including `hyp2f1` itself — is allowed, on
purpose. Using the baseline where it is reliable and something better where it
is not *is* the expert answer here; the search's job is to find where the line
falls and what to do on the far side of it, from `(a, b, c, z)` alone, with no
sight of the answer.

## The fourth task — LLM-SRBench, and a benchmark this repository did not build

The three tasks above are scored against a Kaggle split, against arithmetic, and
against an arbitrary-precision reference. Two of the three run on suites
constructed *here*, which is stated wherever they are reported and is the
standing objection to both: the people who built the task also set the bar.

[`examples/era/era_llm_srbench.py`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/examples/era/era_llm_srbench.py)
answers that objection directly. It runs
**[LLM-SRBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10415)** (ICML 2025 Oral) — a
published benchmark for scientific equation discovery, built by other people,
with its own metrics and its own leaderboard of LLM-based methods. Nothing about
the problems, the splits, the tolerance or the metric definitions is this
repository's choice.

| | |
|---|---|
| Problems | 240 in five subsets: `lsr_transform` (111 Feynman equations rearranged into unfamiliar forms) and `lsr_synth` (chemistry 36, biology 24, physics 44, materials 25) — the paper's abstract says **239**, see below |
| Samples | LSR-Synth: 4 000 train / 500 in-domain test / 500 **out-of-distribution** test. LSR-Transform: 80 000 / 20 000, no OOD split |
| Metrics | The paper's own: `NMSE = Σ(ŷ−y)² / Σ(y−ȳ)²`, and `Acc_τ = 1(max_i \|(ŷ_i−y_i)/y_i\| ≤ τ)` with τ = 0.1 |
| Baseline node | Sequentially thresholded least squares over a fixed nonlinear library — SINDy's fitting step (Brunton et al., 2016) without its domain-chosen library |

The **240 is the released data's count, and the paper says 239.** The gap is one
physics problem: the paper's text reads "111 problems in the first category
(LSR-Transform), and 128 problems in the second category (LSR-Synth), spanning
… chemistry (36), biology (24), physics (43), and material science (25)", while
the benchmark's own gated HuggingFace dataset card lists `lsr_synth_phys_osc` at
44 — and the ungated mirror agrees with the card. This port follows the data,
because the data is what gets scored: dropping a problem to make the abstract's
arithmetic work would be reporting a benchmark nobody published.
`test_the_released_data_holds_240_problems_where_the_paper_says_239` pins it so
it stays a recorded fact rather than something quietly "fixed" later.

### What the candidate is asked for

```python
def discover(x, y, spec):   # x: (n, d) float64, y: (n,) float64
    ...                     # -> a closed-form equation, as a string
```

`spec` carries the column names, the output name, the benchmark's own
one-paragraph description of the science, the per-problem time budget, and
`spec["evaluate"]` — the grader's parser, so a method can score the forms it is
proposing with the same code that will score its answer.

The **answer is a string that is parsed, never executed**. The grammar admits
numeric constants, the problem's variables, `pi`/`e`, `+ - * / **`, and a fixed
list of elementary functions; it refuses comparisons, indexing, attribute access
and every name outside that list. Two things follow, and both are load-bearing:

* **It stays equation discovery.** A gradient-boosted regressor or a
  nearest-neighbour table would win on in-domain test points and has discovered
  nothing. Neither can be written down in this grammar. Nor can a piecewise
  answer with enough branches, which is why `where` and the comparison operators
  are absent rather than merely undocumented.
* **The held-out samples stay out of reach.** The candidate is handed the
  training arrays and nothing else; the test and OOD arrays are opened *after*
  `discover` returns, and only ever by an interpreter walking an AST that has
  already been validated. There is no moment at which candidate code and
  held-out data are both live.

### Why the score means something

**The benchmark is somebody else's, and so is the yardstick.** `Acc_0.1` and
NMSE are the paper's definitions, transcribed from §3 and checked in
`tests/test_era_srbench.py`. The paper reports both per domain for LLM-SR, LaSR,
SGA and direct prompting across three model backbones, so a number from here has
somewhere to sit — with the caveat in the next paragraph attached to it.

**The protocol is ERA's, not the benchmark's.** LLM-SRBench evaluates searchers
that see *one problem at a time*, with the data in the model's context and a
per-problem sample budget. Here the model never sees a data point: it writes one
program, and that program is run sandboxed against every problem in the set.
Same benchmark, same splits, same metrics, **different experiment** — which is
recorded in every result file under `comparability`, in the module docstring, and
here. The two are not interchangeable, and a table that put them in the same
column without the note would be misleading.

**The data is checked, not trusted.** The benchmark's own HuggingFace release
(`nnheui/llm-srbench`) is gated and returns 401 without a token, so this task
reads an ungated re-upload (`pkuHaowei/llm-srbench`), pinned to a revision.
`tests/test_era_srbench.py::test_the_published_equations_reproduce_the_published_samples`
re-evaluates every ground-truth expression that parses against the samples
shipped beside it and requires NMSE < 1e-6 — which is what ties the mirror to the
published benchmark. Two subsets' ground-truth *strings* are damaged in that copy
(36 chemistry expressions carry a mangled parameter, `0.189…_z`; 44 physics
expressions are templates whose `F0`/`beta`/`omega0` have no values), so they are
excluded from that check and the test asserts they are still broken — a mirror
that quietly fixed them should make the note stale, not silently pass. Scoring
never touches those strings: it is numeric throughout.

**The tree ranks on `min(12, -log10(NMSE))`, averaged over the problem set.**
`Acc_0.1` is an indicator per problem — flat almost everywhere, so a search
cannot descend it — and raw NMSE spans twelve orders of magnitude, so a mean of
it is whichever problem failed worst. The cap is the precision of the published
samples themselves, which are stored as float32: a ground-truth expression
re-evaluated on them lands at NMSE ≈ 1e-13. Both benchmark metrics are reported
beside it, for in-domain and OOD alike.

### Deviations this task adds

1. **A non-finite prediction fails the problem here; upstream drops the point.**
   `bench/pipelines.py` computes NMSE over `~isnan(y_pred)`, so an equation with
   a pole inside the test range is scored on the points either side of it. This
   port counts a non-finite prediction as a failed problem, because a search told
   otherwise learns to place poles. Both numbers are reported —
   `nmse` under this rule, `nmse_upstream` under the paper's — so a result here
   can still be laid beside a result there.
2. **The candidate is handed an evaluator.** `spec["evaluate"]` exists because
   the AST gate refuses `eval`, and a symbolic-regression method that cannot
   evaluate its own candidate forms would have to re-implement the grammar and
   hope its copy matched. A near-miss there shows up as a good method scoring
   zero, which is a defect in the harness rather than a fact about the method.
3. **The per-problem budget is enforced with `SIGALRM` in the runner**, not
   trusted to the candidate. Without it one method that fails to return on one
   problem costs every remaining problem in the shard its score.
4. **The runner imports numpy**, unlike its two siblings, which are standard
   library only: the candidate is handed float64 arrays and its answer is scored
   against more of them.
5. **Shards are dealt per domain**, not by shuffling the pooled list: every
   shard holds each of the four domains to within one problem. A draw that
   handed one shard no physics at all is otherwise perfectly ordinary at these
   sizes, and a node's score would then depend on which shards the verifier drew.
6. `score = mean digits` with no sign flip — FUTS maximises — and the engine's
   `[0, 1]` reward is `mean_digits / 12`, exactly order-preserving with what the
   tree ranks on.
## The fifth task — AlgoTune, and the other axis

The four tasks above optimise **accuracy**: lower RMSE, more correct digits, a
closer equation.
[`examples/era/era_algotune.py`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/examples/era/era_algotune.py)
optimises **speed**, and holds accuracy fixed while doing it.

[AlgoTune](https://github.com/oripress/AlgoTune) (Press et al.,
[arXiv:2507.15887](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15887)) is 154 widely used maths,
physics and computer-science functions. Each ships three things: a
`generate_problem(n, random_seed)`, a reference `solve(problem)`, and an
`is_solution(problem, solution)` oracle. The goal is a program that produces the
same outputs as the reference while being faster, and the score is exactly that
ratio.

Two properties make it worth running under FUTS rather than only under
AlgoTune's own agent:

**The baseline is the state of the practice.** `scipy.linalg.eig`,
`scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` on a stiff system, `scipy.signal.upfirdn`,
`scipy.spatial.Delaunay`, `scipy.sparse.linalg.eigsh` — decades-old library code
a working scientist already calls. A tree that improves on it has found
something about the library, not about the benchmark.

**Correctness is a precondition, not a term in the objective.** A solution
`is_solution` rejects scores nothing at all, however fast it was. That is
upstream's rule — `aggregate_results` sets `mean_speedup` to `None` the moment a
single instance fails — and it is what stops the search from discovering that the
fastest way to compute an SVD is not to compute it. In this port such a candidate
still becomes a node, scoring `-inf`, exactly as a program that would not import
does.

### One tree per task

Each AlgoTune task gets its own flat-PUCT tree, its own root, its own held-back
shards and its own line in the result file. They are separate searches over
separate program spaces — a factorisation trick found for `qr_factorization` is
not a node in `ode_stiff_vanderpol`'s tree and could not be selected there — so
one tree across tasks would be an averaging artefact rather than a search.

Across tasks the run reports the **geometric** mean of the per-task speedups.
The arithmetic mean of ratios is not one: 4x on one task and 0.25x on another is
no change on average, and the arithmetic mean calls it 2.1x.

### What the candidate is asked for

A module-level `solve(problem)` — not AlgoTune's `class Solver`, which is the
port's one contract-level deviation, because ERA's gate checks for a function and
a second contract for one task would be a second thing to keep right. The
mutation prompt carries upstream's own `description.txt` verbatim, the parent's
code, its measured speedup, and the per-problem timings behind that number.

The root node *is* the reference implementation, lifted out of its `Task` class
into a runnable program by
[`derive_seed_program`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/examples/era/_algotune_tasks.py):
the module's imports are kept, `solve` becomes a module-level function, every
`self.x` it reads is lifted — a helper method into another function, an
`__init__` constant into a module constant — and anything else raises rather than
being guessed. `tests/test_era_algotune.py` checks the derived program computes
what the class computed, because a speedup measured against a reference that is
not the task's reference is a measurement of nothing.

### Where the numbers come from

* **Problem sizes are upstream's published ones.** AlgoTune's own
  `reports/generation.json` records, for every task, the `n` at which the
  reference took ~100 ms on the machine the dataset was generated on. Reading it
  rather than re-calibrating means two runs of this port are comparable without
  either of them measuring the host it happened to land on. `--size-scale`
  shrinks it and says so in the result file.
* **A shard is a set of seeds, not a file of problems.** AlgoTune's problems are
  numpy arrays, sparse matrices and graphs that no JSON survives intact, and
  `generate_problem` is deterministic — so the seeds cross the sandbox boundary
  and the problems are rebuilt inside it. The last `--test-shards` sets are never
  shown to the search.
* **The reference is re-timed beside the candidate**, in the same sandboxed
  process, on the same problem, moments apart, reference first. A baseline
  measured once on the host and reused would fold the whole run's scheduling
  weather into the score, so the score would move when the machine got busy
  rather than when the program got faster.
* **Timing is the minimum of `--repeats` runs after a discarded warm-up**, which
  is what AlgoTune keeps (`min_time_ms`) and divides. Each run is handed its own
  deep copy of the problem, made outside the timed region: identical arguments
  across repeats would let a candidate memoise on the first run and report the
  dictionary lookup of the second as its runtime.
* **A candidate more than 20x slower than the reference is measured once.**
  Repeating it would spend the shard's whole wall-clock proving a number already
  in hand, and letting it overrun the timeout would record a correct-but-slow
  program as one that failed to run — a different claim.

### Which tasks, and why not all 154

72. Two mechanical filters, both checked by the test file rather than asserted:
the reference must import only numpy, scipy and the standard library (82 tasks
need cvxpy, OR-Tools, networkx, sklearn, torch, faiss, python-sat, sympy, POT,
hdbscan, numba or dace), and it must lift out of its class.

`lqr` clears both and is still excluded: its own `is_solution` does
`float(xt.T @ Q @ xt + ut.T @ R @ ut)` on a 1x1 array, which NumPy has refused
since 1.25 — so on any current NumPy the *reference implementation* is invalid by
the task's own oracle. That is upstream's defect, and searching against an oracle
that rejects its own baseline would measure nothing. `--list-tasks` prints the
runnable set.

### Deviations this task adds

1. **`literal_top_level=False` on the gate**, as for the integrals task and for a
   stronger reason: a precomputed table, a cached plan or a preallocated
   workspace is exactly what makes a numerical routine fast, and a gate that
   refused them would reject the candidates the task is looking for.
2. **4 GiB of address space** rather than the other tasks' 2 GiB. An AlgoTune
   problem at its published size can be hundreds of megabytes on its own —
   `outer_product` at n=10630 is a 904 MB result — and every timed run is handed
   its own copy.
3. **`--candidate-timeout` defaults to 120 s**, twice the other tasks', because
   every problem here is timed twice.
4. `score = mean speedup` with no sign flip — FUTS maximises and faster is
   better — and the engine's `[0, 1]` reward is `s / (1 + s)`, order-preserving
   with it and with no ceiling to saturate against: a 40x candidate still outranks
   a 20x one, where a rescale by an assumed maximum would flatten both to 1.0 and
   blind the acceptance gate exactly where the task gets interesting.

### The result

6 expansions, 6 mutation calls, 0 failures, 8,962 tokens, 99.0 s of model time,
427.3 s of wall clock. Every figure below is scored on the **test** shards,
which the search never saw:

| | baseline | best found | |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| test RMSE | 0.72968 | **0.59133** | −19.0% |
| held-out gate RMSE | 0.73915 | **0.58245** | the split the tree ranked on |
| framework reward `1/(1+RMSE)` | 0.5750 | **0.6320** | |

The baseline is upstream's own `LinearRegression` seed. The winner is a
`GradientBoostingRegressor` with early stopping over ten engineered features —
income × age / rooms / occupancy interactions, a longitude × latitude location
term, a distance-to-origin term, a high-income flag — and predictions clipped to
the target's known `[0, 5]` bounds. It is written to
`era-agentdescent-result-best.py` beside the JSON.

The tree machinery is live: 7 nodes, all 7 valid, root visited 6 times, max
depth 2, and `--staleness full` considered 6 cards and discarded none.

!!! note "Two things this run measured that the score does not show"
    **The gate is 95% of the wall clock, and workers are what starve.**
    `merge_gate_seconds` was 406.1 s of a 421.9 s run, and
    `worker_starved_seconds` 128.8 s. Every surviving card is re-executed across
    four held-out shards, and each of those is a full training run on 29,709
    rows inside the sandbox — on the merger thread. The parallelisable part is
    the model call (99 s across all six), so on this port **more `--workers` buys
    almost nothing**; `--eval-concurrency` and `--pipelined-gate` are the levers,
    and a speedup row here would be measuring the sandbox, not the scheduler.

    **Asynchrony makes the tree root-heavy.** Five of six expansions attached to
    the root, because sweep 1 dispatched four proposals before any sibling had
    been inserted — with one node in the tree, `argmax(puct)` can only return the
    root. The offline canned-model run showed the same effect more sharply
    (depth 1 async against depth 2 sync at the same budget). It cost nothing
    here, since the best node happened to be a root child, but it is a real
    semantic effect of the barrier-free schedule, and it is why tree depth
    belongs beside the score rather than in a footnote.

!!! warning "One run, one seed, and no serial control"
    This is a single live run. No `--serial` arm was measured, so **no speedup or
    parallel-efficiency claim is made here** and the ERA row in
    [port-fidelity.md](port-fidelity.md#the-parallelisation-matrix) is empty
    rather than filled from one arm.

and the winning program
[`bench/results/era-integrals-run-best.py`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/bench/results/era-integrals-run-best.py).

### The result

12 expansions, 13 mutation calls (one stalled on the endpoint and was retried by
`with_retries`), 23,877 tokens, 615.9 s of model time, 391.0 s of wall clock.
Every figure below is on the **test** problem sets, which the search never saw:

| | baseline | best found | |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| test mean correct digits | 8.862 | **10.205** | +1.34 |
| test problems at 10+ digits | 20 / 36 | **28 / 36** | |
| held-out gate mean digits | 8.681 | **10.139** | the split the tree ranked on |
| framework reward `digits / 12` | 0.7234 | **0.8449** | |
| integrand calls over the test set | 33,828 | 221,277 | of 7.2 M allowed |

The baseline is `scipy.integrate.quad` on defaults. The winner keeps `quad` as
its kernel and supplies what `quad` cannot infer: an explicit `t/(1 - t²)` map
for `(-inf, inf)` and `t/(1 - t)` for a half-line, a singular point declared at
the join, a ladder of `(limit, epsabs, epsrel)` settings that stops as soon as
the returned error estimate is below `1e-12`, and a wrapper that turns a raised
or non-finite integrand value into a zero rather than a dead program. That is
the shape of the task: not a better formula, but the transformation and the
error control an expert would add around a library routine.

The tree machinery is live: 13 nodes, 12 valid, **depth 3**, root visited 12
times, and `--staleness full` considered 12 cards and discarded none.

!!! note "Two things this run showed that the score does not"
    **The class that survived is the one that needs real analysis.** All four
    of the winner's zero-digit failures are the same family — an oscillation on
    `[0, inf)` whose amplitude never decays. Truncating that tail is wrong at
    any truncation point, and no tolerance setting rescues it; it wants
    half-period splitting plus a convergence acceleration, which is a different
    program rather than a better-tuned one. The remaining headroom is therefore
    concentrated and identifiable, which is what a benchmark is for.

    **A node died on an import the gate had allowed.** One expansion wrote
    `from scipy.interpolate import pade`, which the AST gate admits — `scipy` is
    on the allowlist — and which does not exist at that path in the installed
    version. It failed inside the sandbox, scored `-inf`, and was appended to
    the tree as upstream requires. That is the gate and the sandbox doing
    exactly what this port says they do: the gate is not the boundary, and a
    program that cannot run is a node rather than a crash.

!!! warning "The first run of this task found a hole in the task"
    The `(-inf, inf)` family was `exp(-x²)·cos(bx)`, which is **even**. The
    first live run's winner mapped both halves of the line onto `[0, inf)` and
    doubled — a plain bug — and scored 12 digits on it. The family now carries
    a nonzero offset, `exp(-(x - m)²)·cos(bx)`, with
    `sqrt(pi)·e^(-b²/4)·cos(bm)` as its closed form, and
    `test_the_whole_line_family_is_not_symmetric_about_the_origin` keeps it
    that way. The numbers above are from a rerun on the corrected suite; the
    first run's are not reported, because they were measured against a suite
    that could be passed without solving it.

!!! warning "One run, one seed, and no serial control"
    As with the S3E1 numbers above: a single live run, so **no speedup or
    parallel-efficiency claim is made from it**. The gate is a much smaller
    share of the wall clock here than on S3E1 (31.3 s of 391 s, against 406 s of
    422 s) because scoring nine integrals is milliseconds where training a
    regressor on 29,709 rows is seconds — so on this task the model call, not
    the sandbox, is what parallelism has to hide.

## Measured results — 2F1

Recorded in
[`bench/results/era-hyp2f1-run.json`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/bench/results/era-hyp2f1-run.json).

### The result, which is mostly a negative one

18 expansions, 20 mutation calls (**2 arrived damaged and were redrawn**),
79,378 tokens, 1,148 s of model time, 404 s of wall clock.

| | baseline | best found | |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| held-back mean correct digits | 9.692 | **9.826** | +0.13 |
| held-back points at 10+ digits | 51 / 80 | **52 / 80** | +1 point |
| gate mean digits | 10.185 | 10.202 | the split the tree ranked on |

That is a real improvement on points the search never saw, and it is **small**.
The comparison that says how small: a **five-line decidable rule** — apply Pfaff
when `z < -1`, pick the branch by which one has the smaller parameters — scores
10.148 against the baseline's 9.732 over all 240 points, about **+0.42**. A
numerical analyst writes that in five minutes. Eighteen expansions of `glm-5.2`
found roughly a third of it.

The tree says where the budget went: 19 nodes, 18 valid, depth 3. **Seven scored
exactly the baseline to six decimals** — programs that build a transformation and
then wrap it in a fallback whose condition never fires, so every point takes the
`scipy` branch. Five scored far *worse* (0.19, 0.88, 0.92, 4.20, 6.52): genuine
attempts at the connection formulas that got a sign or a branch wrong. Only one
node beat the root at all.

The winner is not a trivial program — it tracks the sign of `loggamma` through
negative arguments, sums with log-sum-exp to control cancellation, and keeps a
series with a convergence test. It is simply not yet better than Cephes at what
Cephes is good at.

!!! note "The gate refused a candidate that reached for arbitrary precision"
    One node died with `gate: import 'mpmath' is not allowed`. That is the
    constraint working exactly as designed: the model correctly identified that
    arbitrary precision would solve the problem, and the allowlist refused,
    because a routine that reimplements mpmath is not comparable with SciPy and
    would be scored against a reference produced the same way it was. The
    refusal is worth more than the node would have been.

!!! warning "Roughly one reply in five arrived damaged, and it was not the model"
    Measured on this endpoint: replies of a few thousand characters came back
    with bytes spliced into the middle of tokens — `return val9.3192`,
    `c_orig,0$ zG$C$F1_orig` — at about **19%**, pooling every certain case (a
    reply that does not parse) over 58 sampled replies. The rate is the same
    through the Anthropic SDK, through its streaming API, and through a
    hand-rolled `urllib` request, while 25 fetches of a similarly-sized file
    over the same proxy hashed identically. So it is the endpoint.

    The **first** 2F1 run was made without the guard, and 3 of its 15 expansions
    died on a `SyntaxError` the model did not write; it finished at 9.692 →
    9.692, no improvement at all. That run is not reported as a result, because
    it measured a channel. `--reply-attempts` redraws a reply that is not Python
    at all and never redraws a program that merely fails — the latter is still a
    node scoring `-inf`, as upstream requires — and every run now records
    `reply_damage` beside its numbers.

    A splice that lands inside a numeric literal still parses, and nothing here
    can catch it. Results measured through this endpoint carry that caveat.

!!! warning "One run, one seed, one sampling mode"
    No `--serial` arm, so no speedup claim. And `--thinking disabled` is a
    choice that changes the model's output, not only its latency: on a task
    whose difficulty is a chain of transformation identities, it may well be the
    binding constraint. This row is `thinking=disabled` and says so.

### The 80-point split had no resolution, and both rows above are inside its noise

The two rows above were measured on a suite of 240 points: 80 for the gate the
tree ranks on, 80 held back. That was not enough, and the arithmetic is not
close:

```
per-point correct digits, standard deviation  : 3.20
  standard error of an   80-point mean        : 0.358 digits
  standard error of a  1000-point mean        : 0.101 digits
```

The outcome per point is close to **bimodal** — a program either handles a
region and scores near the 12-digit cap, or misses it and scores near zero — so
the spread is enormous and averaging 80 of them settles very little. The
smallest gain an 80-point gate can separate from noise at two standard errors is
**0.72 digits**. Every number in the two rows above is smaller than that.

Pairing does not rescue it: the paired difference between two programs on the
same points has an SD of 3.05 against the unpaired 3.20, because when a program
changes a point it changes it by ten digits rather than by a tenth.

**So the suite was regenerated at 250 points a shard — 3000 points, a 1000-point
gate and 1000 held back** (`tools/gen_hyp2f1_stress.py`, twelve minutes of
arbitrary-precision arithmetic, committed). Evaluation cost is not the reason it
was small: a 250-point shard takes the baseline 0.30 s and the best evolved
program 0.36 s, and scoring a node across the whole 1000-point gate takes 1.7 s.

### What the resolving gate says about the run that was already made

Re-scored on **1000 fresh points** it had never seen:

| | mean digits | 10+ digits | vs baseline |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| baseline `scipy.special.hyp2f1`, 1000-point gate | 9.801 | 642 / 1000 | — |
| baseline, 1000 held back | 9.836 | 659 / 1000 | — |
| **the 48-expansion winner, on 1000 fresh points** | **10.148** | **737 / 1000** | **+0.347 ± 0.10, 3.2 SE** |

**That reverses the reading recorded here earlier.** The 48-expansion search did
produce a genuinely better program — about a third of a digit, and 95 more
points solved out of 1000 — and the old split could not see it. What the old
numbers showed (gate +0.56, held-back −0.15) was two draws from a distribution
with a 0.36-digit standard error. The earlier text called that a winner's curse;
it was an unresolved measurement, and the diagnosis was wrong.

The corroborating detail: on the new suite the gate half and the held-back half
score the baseline at **9.801 and 9.836**, a gap of 0.035. On the old suite the
same two halves differed by **0.49** — the "gate is easier than the test set"
effect visible in the earlier rows was itself noise.

### And what it does for a run made under it

48 expansions again, same model and sampling, `--workers 6` this time, scored
against the 1000-point gate
([`era-hyp2f1-run48-gate1000.json`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/bench/results/era-hyp2f1-run48-gate1000.json)):

| | baseline | best found | |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| gate mean digits (1000 points) | 9.801 | **11.737** | **+1.936** |
| **held-back mean digits (1000 points)** | 9.836 | **11.771** | **+1.935** |
| held-back points at 10+ digits | 659 / 1000 | **965 / 1000** | |
| over all 3000 points | 9.849 | **11.738** | +1.889, 1970 → 2880 solved |

**The gate and the held-back set now agree to 0.001 digits** (+1.9359 against
+1.9346). That is the whole point of the resize: the two halves of the same
distribution finally say the same thing, so a gate improvement is evidence about
the program rather than about which 80 points were drawn.

**What the program actually found — corrected after review.** An earlier
version of this section claimed the program was "past the transformation-picking
ceiling" because an oracle over four textbook transformations reaches 10.98
while the program reaches 11.74. That comparison was invalid: the oracle basis
excluded the identity the program itself uses. Measured over a basis that
includes it:

| on all 3000 points | mean digits | 10+ digits |
|---|---:|---:|
| `scipy.special.hyp2f1` | 9.849 | 1970 |
| **the z→1/z connection formula, applied blindly, no selection at all** | **11.253** | 2772 |
| the evolved program | 11.738 | 2880 |
| oracle over 4 textbook transformations *(the old, invalid basis)* | 10.981 | 2485 |
| oracle over those 4 **plus z→1/z** — still unreachable, it needs the answer | **11.919** | 2961 |

So the evolved program sits **below** the transformation-picking ceiling, not
above it, and **74% of its gain (+1.40 of +1.89) comes from one identity applied
without any selection at all**. Instrumenting the winner confirms the mechanism:
the z→1/z branch answers 2775 of 3000 points, SciPy 101, the direct Taylor 106,
the Pfaff branch 18.

The honest result is still a real one, and it is this: **the search rediscovered
the z→1/z connection formula and a `z < −1` switching rule**, which is worth
+1.9 digits on this distribution. It is not evidence that the program carries
machinery beyond the identities — a review found that `_safe_gammaln` is defined
and never called, `numpy` and `poch` are imported and never used, the
"complex" Taylor summation has an imaginary part of exactly zero at all 3000
points (because `cmath.log(-z)` is real for `z < 0`), and `_analytic_cont` is
invoked **zero** times on the suite.

Cost: 598 s wall, 52 calls, 210 k tokens, 4 replies damaged. The same 48
expansions at `--workers 3` took 1,280 s, so raising concurrency to the
endpoint's measured knee bought **2.1×**.

!!! warning "Better on 1284 points, worse on 111, and 13 of those catastrophically"
    Across all 3000 points the winner gains 6,142 digits and loses 475. The
    losses include **13 points where the baseline had 10+ digits and the winner
    has under 1**. A mean is the right headline and the wrong acceptance rule: a
    numerical library does not ship a change that breaks thirteen inputs it used
    to get right, however good the average. The lever for that is an acceptance
    condition of "mean improves **and** no new catastrophic regression", which
    is a counting statistic and far less noisy than the mean it guards.

!!! danger "Two wrong identities in the winning program, in branches the suite never reaches"
    A specialist review of the artifact found two mathematical errors, both
    confirmed here independently.

    **The z→1−z connection formula has both Γ coefficients wrong**
    (`_analytic_cont`). DLMF 15.8.4 requires
    `C₁ = Γ(c)Γ(c−a−b)/(Γ(c−a)Γ(c−b))` and `C₂ = Γ(c)Γ(a+b−c)/(Γ(a)Γ(b))`; the
    program divides the first by `Γ(a)Γ(b)` and writes the second as
    `Γ(c)Γ(1−c)/(Γ(c−a−b)Γ(1+a+b−c))`, which is neither. At
    `a=0.3, b=0.7, c=1.9, z=0.6` it returns −0.0965 where the value is 1.0895 —
    **zero correct digits**. It computes `Γ(c−a)` and `Γ(c−b)` and then never
    uses them.

    **The `a ≈ b` guard applies the wrong Pfaff transformation.** Pfaff needs
    `₂F₁(a, c−b; c; z/(z−1))`; the branch sums `₂F₁(a, a; c; z/(z−1))`, which
    agrees only on the line `c = 2a`. At `a = b = −2.3, c = 4.1, z = −6` it
    returns 198.85 where the value is 0.7448 — 267× too large, and SciPy gets
    that point right.

    **Neither is visible to the benchmark.** `_analytic_cont` is never called on
    the 3000 points, and the probability of `|b−a| < 10⁻⁵` under `U(−30,30)²` is
    about 3×10⁻⁷, so the suite contains no point that would exercise either. A
    benchmark that cannot reach a branch cannot penalise it — which is an
    argument about this suite's coverage (see below), not a defence of the code.

!!! warning "What the suite does not sample at all"
    Measured on the committed file: **0 points** with `z ≥ 1` (excluded by
    construction, `Z_HIGH = 0.999`), **1 point** above `z = 0.99`, **0 points**
    with `a` or `b` a non-positive integer (the terminating/polynomial case —
    the most common practical use of ₂F₁, and measure zero under a uniform
    draw), **0 points** with `b−a` or `c−a−b` within 10⁻⁶ of an integer (the
    logarithmic cases where both connection formulas degenerate), and **0.5%**
    with all of `|a|, |b|, |c| < 5`, which is where most real calls live.
    92.5% of the suite sits in `z < −2.2`, the single region the winner's main
    branch covers. The +1.9-digit headline is a true statement about this
    distribution and a weak proxy for "beats SciPy at computing ₂F₁".

!!! note "A silent splice, in the winning program"
    Line 65 of the winner reads `w = z / (z - 1/ 1.0)`. Nobody writes `1/ 1.0`;
    it has the shape of the transport damage documented below, and it parsed, so
    the guard could not see it. It is harmless here — `1/1.0` is `1.0`, so the
    expression is the Pfaff argument it was meant to be — but it is a concrete
    instance of the limitation stated there: a splice inside a numeric literal
    survives every check this port has.

!!! note "What survives from the earlier reading"
    Two observations do not depend on the resolution and still stand. The tree
    spent its budget badly: the best score appeared at **expansion 8** and the
    remaining 40 expansions produced exact copies of it, chains 14 deep in which
    every node scores identically because each rewrite preserved the parent's
    behaviour. And the reply channel damaged **12 of 60** replies, 20%, matching
    the ~19% estimated over 58 earlier samples.

!!! tip "The two levers still worth pulling"
    A **behavioural signal in the prompt** — "your last program changed nothing
    on 19 of the 22 points its parent failed" is computable host-side without
    revealing an answer, and aims straight at the plateau. And **storing the
    top-K node programs**, so gate-versus-test correlation can be measured
    directly rather than inferred from whichever program happened to win.

## Measured results — LLM-SRBench

Scoped to **LSR-Transform**: 111 Feynman equations rearranged so the closed form
being asked for is not one a model has memorised. LSR-Synth is a run this port
has not finished, and nothing about it is claimed here.

### The method

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Protocol | `--per-problem` — one independent search per problem, which is the benchmark's own |
| Answer format | `--answer-format program`, upstream's: `equation(..., params)` source with ten `params[i]` holes |
| Root | `--seed-program linear`, LLM-SR's own skeleton `params[0]*x1 + ... + params[n]`, transcribed |
| Fitting | the harness, one `scipy.optimize.minimize(..., method='BFGS')` from `[1.0]*10` — verbatim upstream |
| Search | sync, 24 expansions per problem, 3 workers, `c_puct=1.0`, `--staleness guarded`, `--seed 0` |
| Data | all 111 problems; `--train-points 4000` of the 80 000 shipped; 25% of train carved out for gating |
| Shards | 6 scored, `held_out_frac=0.5`; the benchmark's own `id_test` split is scored once at the end |
| Budget | 20 s per problem, `--max-tokens 12000` |

The answers never touch the test split, and the ground truth is read by nothing
in the loop.

### The result

Two models, every flag identical, so only the model differs:

| LSR-Transform, all 111 | Acc(0.1) | median NMSE | mean `min(12, -log10 NMSE)` | at the cap | spent all 24 expansions | calls/problem |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `glm-5.2` | 36.9% | 0.102 | 4.805 | 34 | **76** | 18.5 |
| **`deepseek-v4-flash`** | **56.8%** | **2.15e-08** | **6.850** | **52** | 62 | **16.5** |

Paired over the same problems: **33 solved by `deepseek-v4-flash` alone, 11 by
`glm-5.2` alone**, 67 tied (exact McNemar, p = 0.0013). Fewer calls per problem,
a third of the wall-clock, and the weaker model is the one that more often
*exhausts* its budget — 76 problems against 62.

Where the twenty points come from is specific:

| input variables | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 8 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `deepseek-v4-flash` | 80% | 70% | **67%** | 62% | 32% | **0%** |
| `glm-5.2` | 40% | 40% | **26%** | 67% | 27% | **0%** |
| problems | 5 | 30 | 27 | 21 | 22 | 6 |

The whole gap is the 3- and 4-variable bands. At five variables the weaker model
is *ahead*; at six they are within noise; at eight **both score zero on all six
problems**. A better proposer moves the middle of the distribution and does
nothing for the tail.

### Symbolic accuracy, the column that separates discovery from fitting

`python -m tools.score_symbolic_accuracy` scores the paper's third metric: is the
answer *the equation*, after removing parameters and constants. On the
`deepseek-v4-flash` run, **46 of the 109 problems whose ground truth is intact**
are judged equivalent — 41.4% on the paper's 111-problem denominator, of which
11 are settled by sympy without any model being asked.

The cross-tabulation is the part worth keeping:

| | SA: not equivalent | SA: equivalent |
|---|---|---|
| Acc(0.1) = 0 | 46 | **0** |
| Acc(0.1) = 1 | 17 | 46 |

Not one problem that failed Acc(0.1) was judged symbolically equivalent, so SA is
a strict subset of the 63 numerical solves — and 17 of those solves are answers
that predict the held-out samples without being the equation.

**The judge is `deepseek-v4-flash`, not the paper's GPT-4o.** A different judge is
a different metric; the scorer records that in its own output and the number
belongs beside the paper's column rather than inside it. Verdicts:
[`era-srbench-deepseek-transform-symbolic.json`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/bench/results/era-srbench-deepseek-transform-symbolic.json).

### Against the paper's own table

Table 2's LSR-Transform block, each method at its best backbone (GPT-4o-mini):

| Acc(0.1) ↑ / SA ↑ / NMSE ↓ | SA (%) | Acc(0.1) (%) | NMSE | budget per problem |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Direct prompting | 7.21 | 6.31 | 0.2631 | ~250 prompts |
| SGA | 9.91 | 8.11 | 0.2321 | ~250 prompts |
| LaSR | 6.31 | **50.45** | **0.0011** | 25 x 10 x 550 x 33 GP mutations, LLM at `llm_weight = 0.001` |
| LLM-SR | **31.53** | 39.64 | 0.0091 | 250 prompts (1 000 samples / 4 per prompt) |
| **here, `deepseek-v4-flash`** | **41.4** | **56.8** | **2.15e-08** | **16.5 model calls** |

The budget column is not one quantity. LLM-SR's 250 is arithmetic from its config
(`global_max_sample_num: 1000`, `samples_per_prompt: 4`); LaSR is a genetic
program with the LLM wired in at a 0.001 mutation weight, so its search is
millions of candidate evaluations and its call count is not a stated number.
Only the LLM-SR row is a like-for-like call comparison.

LaSR's own row is the sharpest statement of what SA measures: **50.45% Acc against
6.31% SA** is a method that fits rather than derives.

Five settings here are still stricter than the benchmark's own: 4 000 training
rows against 80 000; selection on a 25% validation slice rather than full-train
MSE; 75% of train available to fit; and a non-finite prediction failing the whole
problem where upstream drops the point and scores the rest. The numbers above are
a floor.

### What the search actually found

Three answers where the model returned a rearrangement rather than a transcription:

| what it is | the truth, as the dataset poses it | what the search returned |
|---|---|---|
| Bohr energy levels, solved for the principal quantum number | `-sqrt(2)*q**2*sqrt(-m/E_n)/(4*eps*h)` | `sqrt(-m*q**4/(eps**2*h**2*E_n))` |
| waveguide dispersion, solved for angular frequency | `c*sqrt(d**2*k**2 + pi**2)/d` | `c*sqrt(k**2 + (pi/d)**2)` |
| relativistic momentum, solved for velocity | `-c*p*sqrt(1/(c**2*m_0**2 + p**2))` | `params[0]*p*c/sqrt(m_0**2*c**2 + p**2) + params[1]` |

The second one is the point of the benchmark in one line: the dataset poses the
cutoff relation with `d` multiplied out, and the search hands back
`omega = c*sqrt(k**2 + (pi/d)**2)` — the form a physicist writes.

Also recovered: the Planck distribution solved for temperature (nested `log`
intact), relativistic Doppler as `omega*sqrt(1 - v**2/c**2)/(1 + v/c)`, the
paramagnetic two-level partition as the two-exponential expansion of
`2n*cosh(mu*B/kT)`, isothermal expansion solved for the final volume with no spare
parameter at all, Zeeman splitting solved for field, the driven oscillator solved
for drive frequency, the particle-in-a-box ground state, and the Langevin
dielectric in its `1/(1+x)` form.

### Why `glm-5.2` stops at 36.9%

Measured rather than argued, because the answer decides what to spend on next.

**Not the budget.** Every one of the 70 failures spent all 24 expansions. The
per-round hazard decays 10.8% → 8.1% → 5.5% and then goes **flat near 3.5%** —
not the shape of a search closing in.

**Not overfitting.** No failed problem ever reached the digit cap on its own
validation split; the median best gate score among failures is 0.555. The search
did not pick a bad answer over a good one, it never generated a good one.

**The hypothesis collapses while the code does not.** Re-running
`omega*(c - v)/c` with every candidate's source kept gives ten nodes carrying
**ten distinct `program_id`s and two physical hypotheses**:

| nodes | answer | score |
|---|---|---|
| 1, 3, 5, 9 | `omega*sqrt(1 - v**2/c**2)` | 0.363 |
| 4, 7 | `params[0]*omega*sqrt(1 - beta**2) + params[1]` | 1.265 |
| 0, 8 | the linear root, unchanged | 1.597 |

Six of ten proposals are the Lorentz factor, which scores **worse than the linear
baseline**, and `(c - v)/c` is never tried. The mutation prompt shows one parent
and one score and no record of what has already been proposed, so the model
re-samples the same prior every expansion. Extended to 72 expansions the same
problem builds a chain **23 deep** and never leaves 1.597.

The tree itself is fine: `d2/foc - d2/d1` at 72 expansions climbs 0.44 → 1.13 →
1.60 → 1.76 → 2.27 → 12.0 along a chain 9 deep, solving at node 30 — past the
original 25-node budget. Which regime a problem lands in is decided by sampling:
43 of the 70 failures end with the **unchanged linear root** as the best of 25
nodes, and structurally identical siblings split opposite ways
(`E_n*h/(2*pi*B*Jz*mom)` solved at node 10; `E_n*h/(2*pi*B*Jz*g_)` failed at 25).

Two measurements name the same quantity from opposite directions. Within one
model, failing trees put **72–88%** of their nodes on a single score and winning
trees **23–31%**. Across models, `deepseek-v4-flash` produces **9–13** distinct
answers per tree against `glm-5.2`'s 3–6. The bottleneck is the diversity of
*hypotheses*, not of programs, and not the budget.
## Measured results — AlgoTune

### The method

**Model** deepseek-v4-flash behind an Anthropic-shaped endpoint
(`--provider claude`, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`), `--thinking disabled`,
`--temperature 0.7`, `--max-tokens 8000`.
**Search** `--iterations 45 --workers 3` per task, synchronous, `--staleness
guarded`, `--c-puct 2.5 --prior-exponent 2`. Every tree finished with 46 nodes.
**Data** `--shards 6 --test-shards 3 --problems 2`, upstream's published problem
size, `--repeats 3` after a discarded warm-up. Three of the six scoring sets are
the acceptance gate's held-out split; the three test sets are never shown to the
search and are what the numbers below are measured on.
**Host** 4 cores, Bubblewrap, threads uncapped on both sides — whatever cores a
candidate can reach, the reference can reach too.
**Prompt** AlgoTuner's own system message, naming no technique.

### The result

The eight tasks AlphaEvolve, MetaEvolve and OpenEvolve all publish, one run
each. Held-back speedup over the task's own reference implementation:

| Task | n | this port | AlphaEvolve | MetaEvolve |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `polynomial_real` | 396 | **540.172x** | 1.014x | 2.457x |
| `convolve2d_full_fill` | 6 | 101.918x | 291.338x | 78.128x |
| `fft_cmplx_scipy_fftpack` | 1860 | **5.019x** | 1.228x | 1.558x |
| `lu_factorization` | 1104 | **4.464x** | 1.300x | 1.311x |
| `psd_cone_projection` | 349 | **3.995x** | 1.795x | 1.914x |
| `fft_convolution` | 542069 | 1.041x | 1.015x | 1.346x |
| `eigenvectors_complex` | 463 | 1.007x | 1.432x | 1.474x |
| `affine_transform_2d` | 1123 | 0.994x | 1.072x | 6.945x |
| **harmonic mean** | | **2.195x** | **1.392x** | **2.045x** |

Ahead on five of eight against each. With a uniform prior — upstream ERA's
`1/N`, which is this port's default — the same eight give **1.440x**, so the
prior is what moves it.

Three caveats travel with that aggregate, and the per-task write-up carries
them in full:
[`bench/results/era-algotune-model-prior.md`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/bench/results/era-algotune-model-prior.md).

* **`lu_factorization`'s 4.464x is the reference's serialisation, not a faster
  factorisation** — it returns numpy arrays where the reference returns three
  1104×1104 matrices through `.tolist()`, which is 132.5 ms of its 183.2 ms
  single-threaded. Legal under `is_solution`, and upstream's own solvers do it,
  but discounting it puts this port at 1.782x.
* **One run per task.** Run-to-run spread on `polynomial_real` alone has been
  measured from 0.983x to 962x at these settings.
* **Neither comparison paper states its problem sizes**, and OpenEvolve — whose
  1.984x is excluded from the table for this reason — runs six of the eight at
  `n` between 10x and 4337x below AlgoTune's calibrated value.

### What the wins actually are

* **`polynomial_real`, 540.172x.** A numba-JIT'd Aberth iteration replacing
  `np.roots`, which builds the companion matrix and takes its eigenvalues. The
  validator compares against `np.roots` at 1e-6 relative L2, so this is a
  numerical result rather than a loophole; re-checked against upstream's own
  `is_solution` on 40 fresh seeds outside anything used in search, 40/40
  accepted. OpenEvolve reaches 321.01x here after their prompt is told "JAX —
  JIT compilation ... can provide 100x+ speedups"; this port names no technique.
* **`psd_cone_projection`, 3.995x.** The reference calls `np.linalg.eig` on a
  matrix it knows to be symmetric, materialises `np.diag(eigvals)`, and does two
  full matmuls. The winner uses `eigh` and `(eigvecs * eigvals) @ eigvecs.T`.
* **`fft_cmplx_scipy_fftpack`, 5.019x.** JAX's JIT'd `fftn` for
  `scipy.fftpack.fftn`. The reference returns its array directly, so there is no
  serialisation to skip here.

## Run it

Preview without an API key, network access, or sandbox process:

```bash
python -m examples.era.era_empirical_software --dry-run
```

```bash
python -m examples.era.era_empirical_software --provider claude --model glm-5.2 \
    --yes --iterations 6 --workers 3 --async --async-ratio 1 --staleness full \
    --shards 8 --test-shards 4 --candidate-timeout 60 --max-tokens 16000
```

Add `--serial` for the upstream serial algorithm (one worker, nothing to merge),
or drop `--async` for the synchronous barrier. `--train-rows N` caps the
training file for a quicker look — it is a difficulty knob, so a capped run is
not comparable to an uncapped one.

`--provider claude` selects an Anthropic-shaped endpoint (`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`
+ `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`); `--provider openai`, the default, uses
`OPENAI_BASE_URL` + `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

The integrals task takes the same flags, plus `--eval-budget` and
`--problem-seconds`:

```bash
python -m examples.era.era_hard_integrals --dry-run

python -m examples.era.era_hard_integrals --provider claude --model glm-5.2 \
    --yes --iterations 12 --workers 3 --async --async-ratio 1 --staleness full \
    --shards 8 --test-shards 4 --candidate-timeout 60 --max-tokens 16000 \
    --eval-budget 200000 --problem-seconds 5
```

LLM-SRBench takes the same flags, plus `--dataset`, `--problems`,
`--problem-seconds` and `--train-points`:

```bash
python -m examples.era.era_llm_srbench --dry-run

python -m examples.era.era_llm_srbench --provider claude --model glm-5.2 \
    --yes --iterations 12 --workers 3 --shards 6 --test-shards 2 \
    --problem-seconds 4 --candidate-timeout 120 --max-tokens 16000
```

`--dataset lsr_synth` (the default) runs the 129 synthetic problems, the only
ones with an OOD split; `--dataset lsr_transform` runs the 111 rearranged Feynman
equations; `--dataset all` runs both. `--problems N` caps the count evenly across
subsets — a difficulty and cost knob, so a capped run is not comparable to an
uncapped one, and every run records exactly which problems it used. Reading the
benchmark's parquet needs `pyarrow`.

`--per-problem` switches to **the benchmark's own protocol**: one independent
search per problem, rather than one program for the whole category.

```bash
python -m examples.era.era_llm_srbench --provider claude --model glm-5.2 \
    --per-problem --dataset lsr_transform --shards 6 --iterations 6 \
    --workers 3 --problem-concurrency 2 --problem-seconds 8 --yes
```

There, `--iterations` is expansions *per problem*, `--shards` is how many slices
of that problem's validation pool the search is gated on, and
`--problem-concurrency` trades endpoint load for wall-clock. Note that rollout
tasks are `shards * (1 - held_out_frac)` and a round proposes one expansion per
task, so `--shards 4 --workers 3` leaves a worker idle.

AlgoTune takes the same flags, plus `--tasks`, `--problems`, `--repeats` and
`--size-scale`. `--iterations` is **per task**, since each task is its own tree:

```bash
python -m examples.era.era_algotune --dry-run
python -m examples.era.era_algotune --list-tasks

python -m examples.era.era_algotune --provider claude --model glm-5.2 \
    --yes --iterations 9 --workers 3 --shards 6 --test-shards 3 --problems 2 \
    --repeats 3 --candidate-timeout 120 --max-tokens 16000 \
    --tasks svd,matrix_exponential,convolve_1d
```

`--shards` wants to be at least `2 x --workers`: half of them become the gate's
held-out split, a round dispatches one rollout per *train* set, and a worker with
no set to be handed simply does not expand. At `--shards 4 --workers 3` a budget
of nine expansions quietly buys six, so the port says so on stderr rather than
letting the result file claim the budget it was given.

`--tasks all` runs all 72; `--tasks default` (the default) runs the eight that
span AlgoTune's categories.

Offline tests: `tests/test_era_example.py`, `tests/test_era_integrals.py`,
`tests/test_era_hyp2f1.py`, `tests/test_era_algotune.py`.
