# Staleness — diffs proposed against a version that moved

!!! note "One field of the bundle"
    This is the `staleness` field of the [Policies bundle](policies.md); where a keyword argument exists it is a shortcut onto that field, and an explicit argument wins over a bundle default.


*Module:* [`agentdescent.staleness`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/agentdescent/staleness.py)
· *API:* [`StalenessPolicy`, `FullStaleness`, `GuardedStaleness`, `ReflectiveStaleness`, `get_policy`](api.md#staleness-policies)

This is the problem parallel self-improvement has and serial self-improvement does
not. A worker reads version 4, spends a minute on a rollout, and proposes a diff
— but three other workers merged in the meantime and the head is now version 7.
Is the proposal still good?

```python
eta = vv_staleness(head, base_version)     # 0 = fresh, larger = the world moved
```

Throwing every stale diff away wastes the expensive part of the run (the
rollout). Accepting every one of them merges changes justified by a state that no
longer exists. The policy is where you choose.

```python
evolve(tasks, reward, agent=agent, staleness_policy=get_policy("guarded"))
```

!!! warning "First, make sure the run *has* staleness"
    A policy can only decide something if `eta` can be non-zero, and on the
    **synchronous** path it cannot by default: `evolve()` takes a fresh snapshot
    at the top of every round and every worker proposes against it, so `eta` is 0
    by construction. Measured over an 8-round run, all 15 staleness decisions saw
    `eta = 0` and returned ACCEPT — `full`, `guarded` and `reflective` produced
    identical runs.

    Two ways to have some:

    | | knob | what it does |
    |---|---|---|
    | synchronous | `evolve(refresh_interval=N)` | a worker keeps its snapshot for N rounds, staggered by worker id |
    | barrier-free | `async_evolve(async_ratio=N)` | a worker resyncs once the head is N versions ahead |

    `refresh_interval` costs no extra ledger read — a worker either adopts the
    snapshot the round already took, or keeps the older one it has.

| policy | `eta == 0` | `0 < eta <= alpha` | `eta > alpha` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `full` | accept | accept | accept |
| **`guarded`** (default) | accept | **rebase** + re-verify | discard |
| `reflective` | accept | rebase | **rebase** — `alpha` is ignored |

`full` is maximum throughput and the reference orchestrator's baseline. `guarded`
is the AReaL bounded-staleness discipline expressed over diffs. `reflective` is
FlashEvolve's top tier: every stale diff gets a replay on the current head, and is
discarded only if the improvement no longer holds — the highest recovery of
otherwise-wasted proposals, paid for in cheap-eval work.

A **contract-breaking** diff is the exception in all three: once stale it is
discarded rather than rebased, because a cross-contract rebase costs more than
re-proposing.

`alpha` is the tolerance, and the [aggregator](aggregator.md) picks it **by
governance layer**, not by measured traffic:

```python
alpha_head = 5     # L1 -- a harness, a verifier: iterating fast, lag expected
alpha_tail = 1     # L2 -- a local skill: a moved head more likely invalidates it
```

The config calls them *hot* and *cold*, which is the intent; the selector is
`classify(artifact)`, which is the [one definition of the
boundary](governance.md#the-l1l2-boundary-is-measured-not-declared). That
substitution has bitten before: while the aggregator re-derived the layer with a
different threshold, an artifact at 0.4 was L1 by governance and got the *cold*
tolerance meant for an L2 skill.

## The trade-off, measured

Measured on the reference domain at `async_ratio=4`, where all three converge to
1.000 ([the numbers](concepts.md#34-async_ratio-roll-flash-the-global-lag-budget)):

| policy | rollouts | stale discarded | wall-clock |
|---|---|---|---|
| Full | ~8k | 0 | ~3.2s |
| Reflective | ~7.8k | ~0.7k | ~3.3s |
| Guarded | ~20k | ~17k | ~5.1s |

Reproduce with
[`examples/rq2_staleness.py`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/examples/rq2_staleness.py)
and [`examples/run_async.py`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/examples/run_async.py).
What the table says:

* **Guarded discards more work than Reflective** — that is the claim under test,
  and it holds regardless of machine speed.
* **Reflective spends fewer rollouts** to reach the same accuracy, because a
  rebased card is a rollout it did not have to repeat.
* Recovering that work never leaves Reflective *behind* Guarded on final
  accuracy.

The counts are in `result.outcomes()` as `all-stale`, and in the async runtime's
`AsyncStats.discarded_stale`.

## `StaleAction` — the three outcomes

```python
class StaleAction(Enum):
    ACCEPT   # merge it as proposed
    REBASE   # cheap re-verification, then merge against the new head
    DISCARD  # settle the evidence card back into the pool
```

`DISCARD` is not deletion. The [evidence card](data-model.md#evidencecard-the-gradient-metadata)
goes back to the pool: the diff no longer applies, but the *observation* that
justified it is still true, and the pool is what a later round draws on.

## Writing your own

```python
from agentdescent import StaleAction

class MyPolicy:
    name = "patient"

    def decide(self, eta: int, alpha: int, contract_breaking: bool) -> StaleAction:
        if contract_breaking and eta > 0:
            return StaleAction.DISCARD
        return StaleAction.ACCEPT if eta == 0 else StaleAction.REBASE

evolve(tasks, reward, agent=agent, staleness_policy=MyPolicy())
```

Anything with a `name` and `decide(eta, alpha, contract_breaking) -> StaleAction`
works. `get_policy(name)` resolves the three built-ins, which is what the
policy loop in `examples/run_async.py` iterates over.

## Its relationship to `async_ratio`

The [lag budget](async.md#async_ratio-the-lag-budget) bounds how far ahead the
workers may run; the staleness policy decides what to do with whatever slips
through anyway. They have to be set together:

* tolerance too tight for the lag budget → everything is discarded, and
  `result.outcomes()` fills with `all-stale` while nothing commits;
* lag budget too tight → the workers idle at a barrier you were trying to remove.

`result.forced_refreshes` is the symptom of the mismatch: cards arriving, nothing
committing, workers forced to resync. A non-zero count means the two knobs
disagree.
