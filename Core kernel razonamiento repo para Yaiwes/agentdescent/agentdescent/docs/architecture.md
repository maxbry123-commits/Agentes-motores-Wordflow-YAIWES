# Architecture

This document explains how AgentDescent's components fit together and how a diff
travels from a worker to a committed change in the shared artifact library.

For the *why* behind each mechanism see [concepts.md](concepts.md); for how to
run the system see [install and first run](install.md); for extending it, [run everything, and extend it](usage.md).

---

## 1. The one-paragraph model

AgentDescent runs **N workers in parallel**. Each worker takes a snapshot of a
shared, versioned **artifact library** (the `Ledger`), runs tasks against it,
and emits a **diff + evidence card** (a "gradient"). A single **Aggregator**
(the "optimizer") collects these diffs per-artifact, resolves conflicts, fuses
complementary ones, accepts them by a statistical test, and commits the winner
back to the Ledger — which is then broadcast to workers. Everything else
(schedulers, verifier, governance) exists to make that loop fast, safe, and
resistant to the three long tails.

            which spends the oracle budget by Ĝ and may VETO it)      §5.3
```

Two decisions in that picture are easy to confuse, and they are different
questions asked by different components:

* the **`TaskScheduler`** picks *which task* a worker rolls out;
* the **[`SelectionPolicy`](selection.md)** picks *which candidate* it starts
  from.

The default `SingleHead` answers the second with "the `dev` head", for every
worker, which is what the engine has always done — so the two arrows into each
worker carry a task and an artifact respectively. Selection sits **above** the
merge rather than instead of it: `k` starting points, `N/k` workers under each,
and the aggregator merging their diffs back into their own starting point.

The three-layer **verifier** (rule / learned / oracle) is the evaluation backend
the Aggregator calls at steps 1–3 and 5 (cheap) and at step 4 (oracle, budgeted).

!!! note "The audit is a gate, not a spot-check"
    It runs *before* the acceptance test and can return `oracle-rejected` outright,
    so it sits on the critical path of every merge that trips `force_oracle` — the
    diagrams used to place it after the commit with a dotted "spot-check" arrow,
    which reads as advisory when it holds a veto.

## 3. Component responsibilities

| Component | Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| [**Evolvable**](data-model.md) | [`evolvable.py`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/agentdescent/evolvable.py) | The interface every unit of evolution implements (`diff`/`apply`/`evidence_eval`). Also `Diff`, `EvidenceCard`, version-vector math. |
| [**Ledger**](ledger.md) | [`ledger.py`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/agentdescent/ledger.py) | Git-backed store. Per-artifact integer versions form the version vector. CAS commits and `dev`/`stable` branches; `commit_atomic` (2PC across artifacts) is provided and tested but not used by any engine path today. Runs git with an isolated config (no system/user `gitconfig`, no hooks, no signing) so a personal git preference cannot decide whether the ledger can write. |
| [**Aggregator**](aggregator.md) | [`aggregator.py`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/agentdescent/aggregator.py) | The optimizer. Buckets evidence by artifact and runs the 7-step merge pipeline. Owns the per-artifact Beta posteriors. |
| [**StalenessPolicy**](staleness.md) | [`staleness.py`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/agentdescent/staleness.py) | Full / Guarded / Reflective. Decides `ACCEPT/REBASE/DISCARD` for a stale diff. Swappable without touching the pipeline. |
| [**Verifier**](verifier.md) | [`verifier.py`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/agentdescent/verifier.py) | rule (cheap subset), learned (noisy + uncertainty), oracle (ground truth, budgeted). The cheap subset is **fixed for the run**, so candidates ranked against each other are always scored on the same tasks; `evolve(cheap_eval_tasks=)` sizes it. |
| [**Schedulers**](duration-scheduling.md) | [`scheduler.py`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/agentdescent/scheduler.py) | `TaskScheduler` (UCB over task **clusters** — the design's `× artifact` axis is not implemented), `AuditScheduler` (oracle-budget allocation + trust; its priority queue has no consumer), `ResumeQueue` (straggler records; nothing resumes them — see §4). |
| [**Governance**](governance.md) | [`governance.py`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/agentdescent/governance.py) | `classify` is the single definition of the L1/L2 boundary (`FAST_MAX = 0.30`), used by the aggregator's staleness tolerance and the audit gate rather than re-derived. L0 is reached by name, not radius, and is read-only to the loop. `L1SerialGate` is a primitive for concurrent merging, not in the path — the shipped runtimes merge on one thread. |
| **Worker (role)** | the `run` / `propose` callables the engine takes ([orchestrator](orchestrator.md)) | rollout + propose. Emits evidence cards; never mutates the Ledger directly. There is no `Worker` class — the role is two callables. |
| [**Sync runtime**](orchestrator.md) | [`orchestrator.py`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/agentdescent/orchestrator.py) | `AgentDescent`: round-barrier DP loop + fork baseline. |
| [**Async runtime**](async.md) | [`async_runtime.py`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/agentdescent/async_runtime.py) | `AsyncAgentDescent`: barrier-free thread pipeline + `async_ratio` + backpressure. |
| [**Parallel paradigms**](parallelism.md) | [`parallel.py`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/agentdescent/parallel.py) | DP / TP / PP partition & recombine primitives. |
| **Reference domain** | [`domains/router.py`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/agentdescent/domains/router.py) | A deterministic keyword-router skill so the whole loop runs with no LLM. See [Orchestrator](orchestrator.md#why-a-synthetic-domain-exists-at-all). |
| **Strategies** | [`evolution.py`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/agentdescent/evolution.py) | What the artifact *is* and how a proposal becomes a diff: `SingleSlot` / `AppendRules` / `KeyedRules`. The key space is the op-space the aggregator merges over. See [Strategies](strategies.md). |
| **Directory evolution** | [`filetree.py`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/agentdescent/filetree.py) · [`treestrategy.py`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/agentdescent/treestrategy.py) · [`runners.py`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/agentdescent/runners.py) | A directory as artifact state: state keys are file paths, so file-level fuse/contradict semantics come from the existing aggregator unchanged. The runner materialises each candidate into a throwaway workspace for a real agent. See [Directory evolution](directory-evolution.md). |
| **Agent layer** | [`agents.py`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/agentdescent/agents.py) · [`backends.py`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/agentdescent/backends.py) | The provider-agnostic `prompt -> text` contract, `WorkspaceAgent` for agents that act in a directory, and the document-task adapter. See [Agents](agents.md) and [Backends](backends.md). |
| **Task sampling** | [`sampling.py`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/agentdescent/sampling.py) | Which task inside a worker's shard to roll out next — `RoundRobin` or UCB over learning signal. See [Sampling](sampling.md). |

## 3.5 What the infrastructure owns, and what the algorithm owns

An evolution algorithm decides *what to try and what to keep*. Everything else --
where a rollout runs, how many run at once, what happens when one dies -- is
machinery. `agentdescent/policies.py` is where that line is written down, as
`Protocol` definitions with no implementations.

| | owns |
|---|---|
| **the algorithm** | task sampling · proposal generation · conflict resolution · fusion · staleness · acceptance · promotion |
| **the infrastructure** | sandbox provisioning, placement, reuse and reclamation · quotas and admission · processes and re-dispatch · secret injection · environment fingerprints · all measurement |

And one thing neither owns, stated as a rule because it is easy to violate by
accident:

> **The algorithm may not see sandbox, process or host identity.** A policy that
> decides differently because a candidate came from worker 3 makes the run
> irreproducible, and makes any comparison between parallel configurations
> meaningless.

The testable form of that rule is purity: the default policies are functions of
`(artifact, cards, versions)` and read no ambient process state -- not
`os.environ`, not the working directory, not the clock. Multiple agents running
the same algorithm in different sandboxes is only a coherent idea if this holds.

Two consequences worth knowing when you write a policy:

* **Contracts are written from the call sites, not from these docs.** This page
  once described the verifier as three methods when the merge path calls four; a
  verifier written from the page raised `AttributeError` half an hour into a run.
  `tests/test_policy_contract.py` now greps the call sites and fails if the
  contract drifts.
* **Everything replaceable arrives in one argument.** `evolve(policies=...)`
  takes a [`Policies`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/agentdescent/policies.py)
  bundle; the individual keyword arguments are shortcuts onto its fields and keep
  working. A field whose implementation has not landed raises rather than being
  accepted and ignored.

## 4. The two runtimes

!!! note "There is one engine now, and two runtimes on top of it"
    There used to be two *stacks*. The data-flow diagram above described the
    reference one --
    [`AgentDescent`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/agentdescent/orchestrator.py)
    and [`AsyncAgentDescent`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/agentdescent/async_runtime.py)
    with their own loops, worker dispatch and merger thread — while
    [`evolve()` / `async_evolve()`](evolution.md), the entry point every algorithm
    port uses, implemented the same shape again. This page called that "a known
    wart rather than a design intent", and it kept costing: two measured fixes
    hand-ported, two early-stop epsilons nobody chose, and three mechanisms the
    general engine re-derived — and got wrong — because the reference stack
    already had them.

    Both reference classes are now **adapters**: they describe the reference
    domain in the vocabulary `evolve()` and `async_evolve()` speak and run that.
    Their public surface is unchanged, and the numbers on the
    [results page](results.md) still come out of them.

    What the general engine gained on the way, each of which was a real gap for
    ordinary callers and not just migration scaffolding:

    | | |
    |---|---|
    | `evolve(refresh_interval=N)` | synchronous staleness. Without it `eta` was **0 by construction**, so `staleness_policy=` could not change a single decision on that path |
    | `RoundInfo.considered` / `discarded_stale` / `conflicts_dropped` / `fused` | what the merge *did*, per round — which `RoundStat` and `AsyncStats` had all along |
    | [`ClusterParallel`](parallelism.md) + `ParallelStrategy.observe` | UCB task-cluster leasing (§5.2 / L-task) moves to the general engine rather than being lost with the reference `TaskScheduler` |

    Partial-rollout **resume** is still unimplemented — `run(rendered, task) ->
    output` is opaque, so there is no continuation state to check point; both
    paths *detect* and count stragglers. What does exist is recovery one level
    coarser: a
    [task whose worker is lost is re-dispatched whole](execution.md#recovery-is-at-task-granularity),
    under the same lease id so a late answer from the original can be dropped.

    Three things the domain translation does not preserve exactly, listed in
    `agentdescent/domains/router.py`: `before_after_delta` and `evidence_eval`
    are measured over the whole cluster rather than the failing subset, and noise
    is per proposal rather than per worker — the general engine has one `propose`
    for every worker and, by design, no worker identity to branch on.

AgentDescent separates *what to merge* (the Aggregator, identical in both) from
*when workers and the aggregator run relative to each other* (the runtime).

That one sentence is the whole difference, and it is worth seeing rather than
reading — because everything the async path has to deal with follows from the
barrier being gone:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph SY["Synchronous - evolve()"]
        direction TB
        SW["workers 1..N<br/>rollout + propose"] --> SB["round barrier:<br/>aggregator.step()"]
        SB -->|"head moves, every worker resnaps<br/>so eta = 0 by construction"| SW
    end
    subgraph AS["Barrier-free - async_evolve()"]
        direction TB
        AW["workers 1..N<br/>never wait"] -->|cards| BUF["EvidenceBuffer"]
        BUF --> MG["merger thread:<br/>drains, merges, commits"]
        MG -->|"head moves, a worker resnaps only once<br/>it has drifted past async_ratio, so eta grows"| AW
    end
```

The consequence that costs the most to rediscover: with the default
`refresh_interval=1` the synchronous path hands every worker the round's fresh
snapshot, so `η` is **zero by construction** and the staleness policy cannot
change a single decision there. Staleness is a property of the *runtime*, not of
the algorithm — which is why `evolve(refresh_interval=N)` exists and why the
[staleness sweep](staleness.md) is meaningless without it.

### 4.1 Synchronous DP — `AgentDescent` (orchestrator.py)

A round barrier:

```
for round in range(R):
    leases = scheduler.select_batch(n_workers)   # UCB-ordered, cycling if
                                                 # there are fewer clusters
    for worker, cluster in zip(workers, leases):
        card = worker.run(snapshot, base_version, cluster.tasks)
        aggregator.ingest(card)
    aggregator.step()                            # <-- barrier: one sweep per round
```

Deterministic and easy to reason about. Used for the RQ1 (merge-vs-fork) and
RQ2 (staleness sweep) experiments.

### 4.2 Asynchronous stage orchestration — `AsyncAgentDescent` (async_runtime.py)

No barrier. Threads run independently:

```
 worker thread (× N)                    aggregator thread (× 1)
 ──────────────────                     ───────────────────────
 loop:                                  loop:
   if drift > async_ratio: refresh        reports = aggregator.step()
   cluster = lease_round_robin()          update published head on commit
   card = worker.run(...)                 sample accuracy
   aggregator.ingest(card)                if stalled: bump refresh epoch
```

Connected only through the thread-safe `EvidenceBuffer`. The rollout/propose and
aggregate/commit **stages overlap** — a worker keeps proposing while the
aggregator is still merging the previous batch.

---

## 5. Concurrency & correctness

Because the reference runtime uses in-process threads, shared state is guarded
explicitly:

- **Ledger** — an `RLock` serializes all git operations; **CAS** is what makes
  the *logical* concurrency safe (a commit whose declared base version is stale
  is rejected, forcing a rebase).
- **EvidenceBuffer** — an internal lock guards the per-artifact buckets so many
  worker threads can `add()` while the aggregator thread `drain()`s.
- **TaskScheduler** — a lock guards UCB state so concurrent `lease_*` / `record`
  calls don't race.
- **Verifier / posteriors** — touched only by the single aggregator thread, so
  they need no locking.

A ledger failure is its own category, distinct from a caller bug (`ContractError`,
propagated) and a backend blip (absorbed and retried): it is infrastructure, it
ends the run, and the drivers still return the artifact evolved so far rather than
raising. See the failure-category table in [evolution.md](evolution.md).

The GIL means threads don't give true CPU parallelism, but the **pipeline
overlap** and every concurrency-control mechanism (CAS, version vectors,
per-diff staleness, backpressure) are real — the same code shape drives a
genuinely parallel process or multi-host pool.

---

## 6. Version vectors & staleness in one picture

```
head (dev):     {mol-router: 7}
worker A base:  {mol-router: 7}   → η = 0   → ACCEPT
worker B base:  {mol-router: 5}   → η = 2   → REBASE (if η ≤ α) or DISCARD
worker C base:  {mol-router: 1}   → η = 6   → DISCARD (Guarded) / REBASE (Reflective)
```

`η(d) = max over touched artifacts (head_version − base_version)`. The active
`StalenessPolicy` maps `(η, α, contract_breaking)` to an action; `async_ratio`
(async runtime only) bounds how large η is allowed to grow before a worker is
forced to refresh. See [concepts.md §3](concepts.md#3-staleness) for the full
treatment.
