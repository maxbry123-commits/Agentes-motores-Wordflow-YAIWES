"""The Aggregator: an optimizer over a discrete artifact space.

This is where the central analogy deliberately breaks (design doc, section 1):
gradients add, diffs do not.  Aggregation is therefore not averaging but
**conflict resolution + statistical acceptance + transactional commit**.

The per-bucket pipeline (design doc, section 4):

    1. trigger + bucket        (section 4.1)
    2. staleness filter        (section 4.2)  per-diff eta, three-way split
       + rebase & cheap re-verify
    3. conflict resolution     (section 4.3)  semantic contradiction / PCGrad-drop
       + candidate fusion tournament          (model-soup style)
    4. audit gate              (section 5.3)  high blast radius / low trust -> the
       oracle decides, and can veto here      optimizer audits itself
    5. Beta-posterior accept   (section 4.4)  P(delta > 0) > 1 - delta
    6. CAS / 2PC commit        (section 4.1)
    7. dual-branch promotion   (section 4.5)  EMA-style dev -> stable, after K
                                              regression-free rounds

The audit is stage **4**, not a post-commit spot-check. It runs before the
acceptance test and returns ``oracle-rejected`` outright, so it is a blocking gate
on the accept path -- the diagrams used to draw it after the commit with a dotted
"spot-check" arrow, which reads as advisory when it holds a veto.
