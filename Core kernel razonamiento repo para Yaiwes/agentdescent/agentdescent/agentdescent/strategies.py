"""The text strategies: what evolves, and how a proposal becomes a diff.

A strategy answers two questions and nothing else -- what the artifact *is* (a
flat ``{key: value}`` state) and what a proposal *means* (a :class:`Diff`).
Everything downstream -- merging, conflict resolution, acceptance, versioning --
is the aggregator's job and needs no cooperation.

**One module per strategy family, none of them in the engine.** These three lived
inside :mod:`agentdescent.evolution` while the file-tree strategy had a module of
its own, so the same concept was filed two different ways depending on when it was
written. The engine imports from here; ``from agentdescent.evolution import
AppendRules`` still works.

* here -- text artifacts: one slot, a playbook, keyed categories;
* :mod:`agentdescent.treestrategy` -- a **directory**, one key per file path.

The key space is the design decision, because it is what can be merged
concurrently: content hashes fuse almost everything, a single slot makes every
round a tournament, categories and file paths sit in between.
