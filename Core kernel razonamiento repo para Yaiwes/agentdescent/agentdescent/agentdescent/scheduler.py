"""The three-in-one scheduler (design doc, sections 3.1 and 5).

AgentDescent treats the long tail as *three* distinct problems, each with its own
mechanism:

* :class:`TaskScheduler` -- L-task (data layer): UCB over **task clusters**, so
  evidence-starved clusters get an exploration bonus and clusters that carry no
  learning signal are down-weighted (design doc, section 5.2). The design frames
  L-task as an *artifact* problem -- head skills flooded, tail skills starved --
  and the cross-product ``(task-cluster x artifact)`` it calls for is **not**
  implemented: :class:`TaskCluster` has no artifact dimension, and both reference
  runtimes register exactly one artifact, as does ``evolve()``, so there is
  nowhere for the second axis to live yet.
* :class:`AuditScheduler` -- L-value (signal layer): allocates the scarce oracle
  budget to high-blast-radius, high-uncertainty, low-trust diffs, and audits the
  aggregator's own merges to prevent self-pollution (design doc, section 5.3).
* :class:`ResumeQueue` -- L-traj (system layer): turn-level checkpoints of
  timed-out rollouts (design doc, section 5.1). **Detection only.** The design
  calls for resuming them against the *latest* ledger, which would yield a free
  A/B signal across versions; nothing in the library pops this queue, so a
  checkpoint is a record that a straggler happened, not work that continues.
  :class:`~agentdescent.async_runtime.AsyncAgentDescent` pushes;
  ``AsyncStats.stragglers_checkpointed`` counts.
