"""Three RL *decision rules*, mapped onto diff acceptance. No gradients.

`docs/concepts.md` carries a table of analogies where every row lands on real
code. This module exists to keep it that way while adding three more rows, and
the first thing worth saying is what it deliberately does **not** contain:

**There is no PPO here, and no GRPO.** There are no parameters, no log
probabilities, no policy distribution, and therefore no importance ratio and no
clipping objective. A class named ``PPOAggregator`` that computes none of those
would make the analogy table stop being a map of the code, which is the only
thing it is good for.

What *is* transferable is three decision rules, and two of them already had a
stub here that was never used as a mechanism:

| RL                          | here                                    | before |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------|
| group-relative advantage    | a proposal's reward against its group's | only the zero-advantage *filter*: `sampling.DifficultyWeighted` drops all-pass/all-fail groups. The relative value itself never reached acceptance. |
| trust region / clipping     | the op and character caps on one diff   | constants (`6` ops, `32_000` chars), chosen by guess |
| KL to a reference policy    | distance from the `stable` branch       | did not exist |

## Everything here is off by default

Not conservatism -- the issue this implements sets the bar itself: *an analogy
without an A/B is decoration*. So the **signals** are computed and recorded (they
are arithmetic over numbers the engine already has, and are useful as diagnostics
on their own), while the **policies that act on them** are opt-in. Each has to
earn its place with a measured A/B on a real dataset before anything here is
described as a mechanism rather than an option, and a rule that fails its A/B
should be deleted, with the negative result written down.

    Policies(acceptance=AdvantageAcceptance(base), conflict=AdvantageConflict())
    AggregatorConfig(trust_region_policy=AdaptiveTrustRegion())

See `docs/concepts.md` for the current status of each.

    A group is **one base version and one task cluster**: rollouts that were
    solving comparable problems against comparable artifacts. Within it,
    ``(reward - mean) / std`` is what GRPO calls the advantage, and it is the one
    part of GRPO that needs no policy distribution to compute.

    Why the engine was missing it: acceptance reads a Beta posterior over
    ``(successes, failures)``, which cannot see *how well the other proposals in
    the same group did*. A proposal that passed everything in an easy group and
    one that beat its peers in a hard group arrive at the gate looking identical.

    **Running, not batched.** The statistics accumulate as rollouts land rather
    than being computed at a round barrier, because the barrier-free runtime has
    no barrier -- a batched version would silently do nothing there, which is the
    worse failure. The consequence is that the first members of a group are
    standardised against fewer peers than the last, which is why:

    **A group smaller than ``min_group`` gets ``None``, not zero.** A z-score
    over two samples is noise, and zero is a *meaningful* advantage value ("did
    exactly as well as its peers"), so returning it for "we do not know yet"
    would put noise into the gate wearing the costume of a measurement.

    A group where everything scored the same also gets ``None``: zero variance is
    the zero-advantage case `DifficultyWeighted` already filters on, and dividing
    by it is how a rounding error becomes a large advantage.
