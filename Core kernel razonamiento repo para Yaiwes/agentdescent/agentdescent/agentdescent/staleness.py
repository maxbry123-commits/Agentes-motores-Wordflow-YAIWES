"""Pluggable staleness policies (design doc, section 4.2; FlashEvolve 2605.08520).

FlashEvolve's central move is to port asynchronous-RL staleness theory onto
*non-parameter* text/code artifacts, and it defines three escalating policies for
what to do with a diff that was proposed against an out-of-date head:

* **Full**      -- use the stale diff directly (max throughput, min safety).
* **Guarded**   -- version-gated: accept only within a staleness budget ``alpha``,
                   rebasing the middle band; discard beyond it.
* **Reflective**-- always attempt to rebase and *re-verify* (an LLM/cheap replay
                   of the evidence on the current head), discarding only if the
                   improvement no longer holds.

AgentDescent additionally borrows ROLL Flash's **asynchronous ratio** -- a *global*
lag budget that decides how far any worker's snapshot may drift from head before
it is force-refreshed (see :class:`~agentdescent.async_runtime.AsyncConfig`).

The aggregator computes ``eta`` and ``alpha`` and asks the policy for one of the
three actions below; the policy is the only thing that changes between async
regimes, so a run can be swapped from Guarded to Reflective without touching the
merge pipeline.
