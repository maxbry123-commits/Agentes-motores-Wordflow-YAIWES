"""Where rollouts run, as a replaceable thing.

Today's answer is threads, and for the workload that is measured to be the right
one: a rollout is almost entirely waiting on a model, and `docs/efficiency.md`
records **7.1x** on I/O against **1.0x** on CPU for eight of them. Nothing here
is an attempt to make rollouts faster by using processes.

What processes buy is different and not available any other way:

* **fault isolation** -- the code being evolved is model-authored, so a segfault,
  an OOM or a runaway allocation is an ordinary Tuesday, and in a thread each of
  those takes the run with it;
* **capacity beyond one machine**, later;
* **heterogeneous workers**, later still.

**Not `ProcessPoolExecutor`.** Four reasons, and the first is disqualifying:

1. one worker dying abruptly breaks the whole pool (`BrokenProcessPool`) and
   every in-flight task with it. Fault isolation implemented on top of something
   that fails as a unit is not fault isolation;
2. `max_tasks_per_child` arrived in 3.11 and this package supports 3.9, so a
   worker that leaks cannot be recycled;
3. it has no notion of a sandbox, and no place to say "this task needs an
   environment with fingerprint X, wait for one";
4. its default start method is `fork` on Linux, and this engine is threaded. A
   `fork` from a process holding locks in other threads produces a child holding
   locks that will never be released.

So: persistent workers, a bounded task queue, and a supervisor that decides on
its own when a worker is gone. About three hundred lines, all standard library.
