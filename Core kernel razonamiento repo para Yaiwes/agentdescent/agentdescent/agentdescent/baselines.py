"""The control every efficiency number in this repository is missing.

Everything measured here so far is **throughput speedup**: how much faster the
same work finishes on N workers. That number cannot answer the question the
project is actually making a claim about, because population-based methods are
already parallel -- fork-and-select saturates N workers just as well, and its
speedup is also close to N. A speedup table therefore cannot tell *merging*
apart from *sampling and selecting*.

One quantity can: **held-out quality at equal rollout budget, merge-of-N against
best-of-N fork.** This module runs the three arms that produce it.

    serial          n_workers=1, B rollouts
    best_of_n_fork  N runs that never talk to each other, B/N rollouts each
    merge_of_n      evolve(n_workers=N), B rollouts

Four things this module refuses to let a caller get wrong, because each of them
has produced a published-looking number somewhere before:

**One workload, not three.** The tasks, reward, actors, strategy and every other
`evolve()` argument come from a single :class:`Workload`, so an arm cannot
quietly get a different sampler or a different held-out fraction. Only the
execution shape varies -- that is the whole design.

**Budget in rollouts *and* calls -- and they cannot both be equalised.** This is
the uncomfortable finding, and it is measured rather than assumed
(``tests/test_baselines.py``). Four forks that never talk to each other each start
from nothing, so nearly every rollout of theirs fails and asks for a proposal;
merge-of-4 shares what the others already learned, so more of its rollouts solve
their task outright and never call the proposer. Fix rollouts and the fork arm
spends over twice the model. Fix calls and the fork arm gets a *quarter* of the
rollouts. The ratio is not a nuisance parameter -- it is a real difference between
the arms, and no budget can make it go away.

So :func:`compare` takes the unit being held fixed and reports the other one
separately: drift in the fixed unit is a **broken comparison**, divergence in the
other is a **confound that has to be printed next to the result**. A merge arm
that wins at equal rollouts *while spending fewer calls* is a robust result. One
that wins at equal rollouts while spending more calls is not, and the table says
so instead of putting "equal budget" in the caption. Both numbers are reported as
measured, never as requested: the synchronous engine checks its budget at the
round barrier and overshoots by up to one round.

**Fork gets two numbers, not one.** The oracle fork (the best fork *on test*) is
an upper bound nobody can ship -- picking it requires the answer. The selected
fork (best on dev, reported on test) is what fork-and-select actually delivers.
Reporting only the first flatters fork; reporting only the second flatters merge.
`run_fork_baseline`'s docstring already drew this distinction for the synthetic
router domain; it belongs on the real path too.

**The domain has to be able to say no.** The router domain is additive by
construction -- each keyword is an independent row, so two workers' diffs almost
never conflict and merging necessarily wins. Demonstrating "diffs can be merged"
there is circular: the property being measured was put in by the domain. Use this
module on a workload where diffs can genuinely contradict each other.

**...and it has to be able to say yes.** The opposite failure is subtler and cost
a real run to find. A strategy that keeps the whole artifact in **one key** --
GEPA's ``InstructionSlot`` is the shipped example -- makes every pair of worker
proposals contradict by construction, so conflict resolution collapses them to
one and the fusion tournament never builds a fused candidate at all. On such a
workload ``merge_of_n`` is per-round **best-of-N selection**, which is a real
mechanism and is *not* merging; a table reporting it as merge-vs-fork is
measuring the wrong thing under the right name.

Check before believing a row: ``ArmResult.fusion.contested`` is the number of
tournaments a fused candidate actually competed in. Zero means the mechanism
never ran (``tests/test_fusion_stats.py`` pins both directions). ACE's playbook,
one key per bullet, is the shipped artifact where it does.

A negative result is a result. If merge-of-N lands within the spread of
best-of-N fork at equal budget, that says parallel merging is a throughput
optimisation on this workload and not a new mechanism, and the claim that
"gradients add, diffs do not" implies more than engineering convenience has to be
written down as unsupported *on that workload, at that budget*.
