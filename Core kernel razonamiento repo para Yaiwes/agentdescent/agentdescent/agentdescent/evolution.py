"""The general evolution engine -- evolve *any* artifact.

This is the module. It is domain-agnostic: it knows nothing about "skills" or
"harnesses". You describe **what evolves** and **the rules of evolution**, and it
runs the parallel, merge-based loop (ledger + aggregator + staleness +
governance) for you.

You provide four things (all customizable, none built in):

* a :class:`Strategy` -- how the artifact is represented, how it renders into a
  prompt/config, and how a proposal becomes a :class:`~agentdescent.evolvable.Diff`;
* ``run(rendered, task) -> output`` -- apply the current artifact to a task;
* ``reward(task, output) -> [0, 1]`` -- score the output;
* ``propose(rendered, task, output, reward) -> str | None`` -- on a failure,
  propose one improvement.

Then :func:`evolve` drives it. The same engine evolves a **skill** (artifact =
a lesson playbook, run = an LLM using it) or a **harness / verifier** (artifact =
routing/context config, higher ``blast_radius`` -> L1 governance) -- see
``examples/skill_evolution.py`` and ``examples/harness_evolution.py``.

An :class:`Agent` (an object bundling ``solve`` + ``propose``) is a convenience
for the common case where the same actor both runs tasks and proposes changes;
:func:`evolve` also accepts ``run`` / ``propose`` callables directly.

        ``alpha_spec`` prefix, compares the partial score against the pool, and
        *guesses*; a wrong guess costs a rollback, which is why the paper keeps
        the whole mechanism optional and out of its main results.

        A guess is unnecessary for rejection. Rewards are contractually in
        ``[0, 1]`` (:func:`_checked_reward` enforces it), so after ``k`` of ``n``
        tasks the best the full set could still reach is
        ``(sum_so_far + (n - k)) / n``. Once *that* is at or below ``floor``, no
        assignment of the remaining tasks can beat ``floor`` -- so the remaining
        ``n - k`` evaluations cannot change any decision that only asks "is this
        better than ``floor``", and buying them is buying a number nobody reads.

        The return value is that upper bound when the scan stops early, and the
        true mean when it does not. Either way ``score_bounded(t, f) > f`` gives
        exactly the answer ``score(t) > f`` would have, which is the property
        that makes this a **cost** optimisation with no effect on any outcome --
        no rollback path, no speculative version, nothing downstream to mark
        stale -- *provided nothing downstream reads the magnitude*. That proviso
        is load-bearing and it is why `AggregatorConfig.bounded_gate` is off by
        default: the shipped gate feeds a rejected candidate's delta into a Beta
        posterior that sets later thresholds, and a bound understates it.

        It is not free of trade-offs, and the trade-off is not accuracy:

        * The returned number is a bound, not a measurement, whenever it stops
          early. A caller that *records* it (a history row, a Pareto axis, a
          reported score) must not use this -- and the two ports that need a
          per-task vector cannot use it at all, since a truncated scan has no
          value for the tasks it skipped.
        * Concurrency is traded for the option to stop: the scan runs a chunk at
          a time rather than fanning out over the whole set at once. ``prefix``
          is that chunk as a fraction of the set, and it is the paper's
          ``alpha_spec``. The paper measures 0.25 as the useful setting and 0.5
          as starving its own validate stage; the reason is visible here too --
          a chunk is a synchronisation point, so a large one gives up the early
          exit while a tiny one gives up the fan-out.

        ``floor`` is the number to beat, usually the base artifact's mean on the
        same tasks. Pass ``-inf`` to disable the early exit and get :meth:`score`
        with extra steps.

    """Evolve an artifact. Provide either ``agent`` (with ``solve``/``propose``)
    or the ``run`` / ``propose`` callables directly.

    ``strategy`` (default :class:`AppendRules`) is the evolution rule. The
    aggregator dedupes, resolves contradictions, fuses complementary changes, and
    commits a change only if it improves held-out reward.

    ``blast_radius`` chooses governance: ``0.2`` is an L2 (fast, local) artifact
    like a skill; raise it (e.g. ``0.6``) for an **L1** artifact -- a harness,
    context policy, tool router, or learned verifier -- which the aggregator
    treats conservatively (every merge forced through the oracle, wider staleness
    tolerance; design spec §6).

    ``parallel`` (default :class:`~agentdescent.parallel.DataParallel`) is the
    parallelism method -- how each round's tasks are partitioned across the
    ``n_workers``. Swap in :class:`~agentdescent.parallel.TensorParallel` or your
    own :class:`~agentdescent.parallel.ParallelStrategy`. ``PipelineParallel`` is
    refused: it needs one artifact per stage and this function evolves one.

    ``max_concurrency`` runs a round's ``n_workers`` **concurrently** (a thread
    pool), then the single ``aggregator.step()`` is the round barrier -- this is
    *synchronous data-parallelism*: the rollout+propose stage of all workers
    overlaps (real wall-clock speedup for I/O-bound LLM rollouts, since Python
    releases the GIL during network I/O), and the merge is the sync point.
    ``1`` (default) keeps the loop sequential and deterministic; set it to
    ``n_workers`` to parallelise. Custom strategies/aggregators that mutate shared
    state from ``propose``/``to_diff`` must guard it (the async runtime's buffer,
    CAS and per-diff staleness already are). For the *barrier-free* async pipeline
    (``async_ratio`` lag budget, staleness policies overlapping the aggregator),
    see :class:`~agentdescent.async_runtime.AsyncAgentDescent`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tasks:
        The work the artifact is evaluated on. Split into train / held-out **by
        position** -- the last ``held_out_frac`` of the sequence is held out, in
        the order given. At least 4 are required and ids must be unique.
    solved_threshold:
        A reward at or above this counts as solved, so no proposal is requested
        and the task sampler counts a pass. The default (:data:`SOLVED`, 0.999) is
        right for a binary scorer. **Lower it for a graded one** -- a ROUGE score
        or an LLM judge rarely reaches 0.999, so every rollout would ask the
        reflector to "fix" an answer that scored 0.95, and the run reports
        ``below-threshold`` as if the reflector were the problem.
    shuffle, seed:
        Shuffle ``tasks`` before that positional split. Off by default, which
        keeps a run reproducible and keeps
        :attr:`~agentdescent.dataloader.Dataset.val_frac`'s promise that the
        engine's held-out split is exactly that ``Dataset``'s ``val``. Turn it on
        for **grouped** data -- anything ordered by category, source, difficulty
        or date -- where the tail of the file is a different distribution from
        the head, and every gate in the run (the acceptance test,
        ``target_reward``, ``final_reward``) would then be measured against it.
    reward:
        ``(task, output) -> [0, 1]``. Scores in ``[0, 1]``; the engine treats
        ``>= solved_threshold`` as a pass (no proposal is requested).
    agent:
        An object with ``solve`` + ``propose``. Provide this **or** ``run`` and
        ``propose``; both signatures are checked before the first rollout.
    run, propose:
        ``run(rendered, task) -> output`` and
        ``propose(rendered, task, output, reward) -> str | None``.
    strategy:
        How the artifact is represented and how a proposal becomes a ``Diff``.
    parallel:
        How a round's tasks are partitioned across workers. ``DataParallel``
        (default) shards them; ``TensorParallel(n_sections, keys=, route=)`` also
        gives each worker a disjoint **section of the artifact** and rejects
        out-of-section edits -- counted as ``section-violation`` in
        :meth:`EvolutionResult.outcomes`. The pairing is validated before the
        first rollout: a strategy with no declared key space (``AppendRules``) or
        fewer keys than sections is refused rather than silently dropping most of
        its proposals. ``PipelineParallel`` raises (see above).
    task_sampler:
        **Which** task a worker rolls out next, from its shard. Defaults to
        :class:`~agentdescent.sampling.RoundRobin`; use
        :class:`~agentdescent.sampling.DifficultyWeighted` to spend rollouts on
        tasks that still carry a learning signal.
    initial_state:
        Seed the artifact instead of starting from ``strategy.initial()``.
        Ignored when resuming an existing ``repo_path``.
    blast_radius:
        Governance layer, in ``[0, 1]`` (see above).
    artifact_id:
        Name of the evolving artifact; becomes a filename, so it must match
        ``[A-Za-z0-9_.-]+``.
    rounds:
        Number of round barriers to run. Under ``asynchronous=True`` this becomes
        a worker-rollout budget of ``rounds * n_workers`` instead.
    n_workers:
        Workers per round (``>= 1``).
    max_concurrency:
        How many of them actually run at once (see above).
    refresh_interval:
        How many rounds a worker keeps its ledger snapshot before taking the
        round's fresh one. ``1`` (default) is what this loop always did: every
        worker proposes against the current head, so a diff's staleness ``eta``
        is **0 by construction** -- and that made ``staleness_policy=`` a knob
        with nothing to decide on this path (measured over an 8-round run: all
        15 staleness decisions saw ``eta=0`` and returned ACCEPT, so Full,
        Guarded and Reflective were indistinguishable).

        Above ``1``, workers hold a spread of versions -- the refresh is
        staggered by worker id -- so their diffs arrive with a spread of ``eta``
        and the staleness policy, the ``alpha`` tolerances in ``agg_config`` and
        the ``all-stale`` outcome all become reachable synchronously. Costs no
        extra ledger read: a worker either adopts the snapshot the round already
        took, or keeps the older one it has. Ignored under ``asynchronous=True``,
        where the lag budget is ``async_ratio``.
    eval_concurrency:
        How many held-out tasks to score at once. Every gate goes through this --
        each round's measurement and, far more often, the aggregator's
        per-candidate comparisons -- so it is the merge half of the run's
        parallelism, independent of ``n_workers``. ``1`` restores the old
        sequential behaviour.
    max_worker_errors:
        How much total failure to tolerate before giving up -- and only while *no*
        worker has ever completed a rollout, which reads as a misconfiguration
        (wrong key, dead endpoint). Once any worker has succeeded the backend
        demonstrably works, so failures are treated as transient and the run
        continues on whatever evidence it did gather. Counts consecutive failed
        rollouts per worker on the async path (see ``result.retired_workers``) and
        consecutive rounds in which *every* worker failed on the sync path.
    target_reward:
        Stop as soon as held-out reward reaches this. Without it a run always
        spends all ``rounds``, including after it has converged -- measured at 43%
        of rollouts wasted on an artifact that had stopped changing.
    patience:
        Stop after this many consecutive rounds with no improvement in held-out
        reward. ``None`` disables it. Cheap insurance for a run that plateaus
        below ``target_reward``.
    round_timeout:
        Seconds a round will wait for its concurrent workers before giving up on
        the slow ones. ``None`` (default) waits forever, which is what you want
        when every rollout is bounded -- but a single hung rollout then stalls the
        run, because the aggregator is a barrier. Abandoned work keeps running in
        the background (Python cannot cancel a thread) and is simply not waited
        for; it is reported when ``verbose``. Only applies when
        ``max_concurrency > 1``.
    pipelined_gate, gate_workers:
        Under ``asynchronous=True``, run a merge's **measurement** phase on its
        own threads instead of on the merger, so the merger goes back to
        draining while the gate runs. Off by default; documented in full on
        :func:`~agentdescent.async_evolve.async_evolve`, which implements it.
        Warns and does nothing on the synchronous path, where the round barrier
        idles every worker for the whole merge regardless.
    resync_on_commit:
        Asynchronous path only. Refresh every worker's snapshot as soon as a
        sweep commits, so no one *starts* a rollout against a superseded
        artifact. See :func:`~agentdescent.async_evolve.async_evolve`, which
        documents what it does and does not fix -- a commit landing mid-rollout
        still produces a stale card.
    asynchronous, async_ratio:
        Delegate to :func:`~agentdescent.async_evolve.async_evolve` -- no round
        barrier, with ``async_ratio`` as the staleness lag budget.
    max_seconds:
        Wall-clock budget. ``None`` (default) means unbounded; the async path
        uses ``20.0`` when unset.
    max_rollouts, max_calls:
        The budget in the two units a comparison has to hold fixed: rollouts
        completed, and actor invocations (``run`` + ``propose``). ``rounds`` is
        not one of them -- configurations differ in how much model a round buys,
        so a budget fixed in rounds hands the wider configuration more model and
        then reports the extra model as a win for parallelism. Either bound stops
        the run with ``stop_reason`` ``"max_rollouts"`` / ``"max_calls"``.

        **Checked at the round barrier, so a run overshoots by up to one round.**
        A round is dispatched or it is not; stopping halfway would leave a
        half-merged round, and the states a comparison compares are the ones a
        merge produced. So a budget is a *bound on where to stop*, never the
        number to compare on: read the spend the run actually reported
        (``result.rollouts``, ``result.usage.calls``), which is what
        :mod:`agentdescent.baselines` does -- it refuses to call two arms
        equal-budget when their measured spends differ.

        The async path has no barrier and enforces both per rollout, so it
        overshoots by at most the rollouts already in flight.
    self_verify:
        Re-run the trajectory with the diff applied to record a local
        before/after delta. Doubles the rollouts spent per proposal; ports that
        score candidates only on held-out should pass ``False``.
    held_out_frac:
        Fraction of ``tasks`` reserved for held-out scoring, in ``(0, 1)``.
    repo_path:
        Where the git-backed ledger lives. Omit for a throwaway repo that is
        removed when this call returns (not held until interpreter exit, so a
        sweep does not accumulate one git repo per run); **passing the same path
        again resumes** that ledger, and a caller-supplied path is never deleted.
        Git runs with an isolated config, so a personal ``~/.gitconfig``
        (``commit.gpgsign``, ``core.hooksPath``) cannot fail the ledger's own
        bookkeeping commits.
    agg_config:
        Tuning for the reference aggregator (batching, acceptance risk, trust
        region, staleness tolerance).
    staleness_policy:
        What to do with a diff proposed against an out-of-date version --
        ``full`` / ``guarded`` (default) / ``reflective``.
    aggregator_factory:
        Replace the optimizer entirely; receives
        ``(ledger, verifier, audit, config, staleness_policy)``.
    oracle_budget:
        Hard cap on full held-out oracle evaluations during audits. Once spent,
        the verifier falls back to its cheap layer -- which only saves anything
        when ``cheap_eval_tasks`` makes that layer genuinely cheaper, so the two
        knobs go together.
    cheap_eval_tasks:
        How many held-out tasks the *cheap* layer scores when the aggregator is
        merely **ranking** candidates -- conflict resolution, and the fusion
        tournament when it is on. ``None`` (default) is **8**, or the whole
        held-out set when that is smaller.

        It used to mean the whole set unconditionally, which made the cheap layer
        cost exactly what the oracle costs: ranking one candidate bought a full
        sweep of real agent calls, and ``oracle_budget``'s fallback saved nothing
        because it was the same measurement. Nothing in ``bench/`` or
        ``examples/`` ever passed this, so every real run paid it.

        The cost of the new default is **ranking resolution**: 8 binary-scored
        tasks resolve 0.125, so two candidates closer than that are ordered by
        whichever the sample happens to favour. That is bounded to *which*
        candidate goes forward -- both commit gates read ``eval_counts`` on the
        full set, so it cannot decide whether a change is safe. Pass
        ``len(held_out)`` to restore the exact behaviour. The sample is fixed for
        the run, so candidates are always compared like-for-like.
    fusion_tournament:
        Rank the surviving diffs against their fusion before putting one forward.
        ``None`` (default) defers to ``agg_config``, which is **off**.

        Off, because the ranking is paid every round while the only decision it
        changes from the acceptance gate's is recoverable: the union is a
        superset of every single diff, so committing it unranked loses no
        proposal. :class:`~agentdescent.defaults.DefaultFusion` carries the case
        analysis.

        On, because it is the only way to *measure*
        :attr:`FusionStats.win_rate` -- ``best_single_score`` exists only where a
        single was actually scored. That number is a property of the workload,
        not of the mechanism, so it is worth measuring per workload and not worth
        paying for on every run.
    on_round:
        Called with each :class:`RoundInfo` as the round completes -- progress
        for a long run, which otherwise reports nothing until it returns. An
        exception raised here is reported but does not abort the run.
    usage:
        Share one :class:`~agentdescent.agents.Usage` with your model adapters
        (``claude(usage=u)``, ``openai_compatible(usage=u)``) and the result's
        token counts become real. Without it the run still reports calls,
        seconds and failures -- ``run`` is ``(rendered, task) -> str``, so an
        opaque actor has no way to surface tokens, and inventing a number would
        be worse than reporting zero.
    verbose:
        Print a line per round. Independent of the ``RuntimeWarning`` emitted
        when a run ends early -- that always fires.
    policies:
        Bundle of replaceable pieces (:class:`~agentdescent.policies.Policies`).
        Every field defaults to ``None`` meaning "current behaviour", so
        ``Policies()`` and passing nothing are the same run. The individual
        keyword arguments -- ``task_sampler``, ``staleness_policy``,
        ``aggregator_factory`` -- are shortcuts onto its fields and keep working;
        an explicit argument wins over a bundle default rather than being
        silently ignored. Fields whose implementations have not landed yet raise
        rather than being accepted and ignored: a caller who passes a custom
        acceptance rule and sees a finished run would reasonably conclude it ran.
        New capabilities go here rather than adding another parameter to a
        function that already has thirty-five.

    Returns
    -------
    EvolutionResult
        The evolved artifact plus ``history``, ``error`` and ``stop_reason``.
        **Check ``error``**: it is ``None`` only on a clean run, and a run that
        died still returns a (partial) result rather than raising. **Check
        ``stop_reason``** to tell convergence (``"target_reward"``) from a budget
        expiry (``"max_seconds"`` / ``"rounds"`` / ``"max_iters"``) -- ``error``
        is ``None`` for both.
