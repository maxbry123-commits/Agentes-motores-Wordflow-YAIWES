"""Provider-agnostic inference -- connect any agent or LLM to the framework.

This is the general "talk to a model/agent" layer. It is deliberately kept
**out of** :mod:`agentdescent.evolution`: skill evolution is just *one* application
built on the framework, and how you reach a model has nothing to do with it.

The whole contract is one type:

    Completion = Callable[[str], str]      # prompt -> text

Anything that maps a prompt to text is a completion -- an LLM call, a
tool-using agent loop, a canned stub for tests. The adapters below build
completions for Claude, an arbitrary callable, or a deterministic echo, and
:func:`with_retries` wraps any of them with backoff. Higher layers
(the evolution engine's LLMAgent, or your own) turn a completion
into whatever task interface they need.
