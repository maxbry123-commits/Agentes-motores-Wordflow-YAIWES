"""Git-backed versioned Ledger (design doc, sections 3.1 and 4.5).

The Ledger is the "parameter server" of the framework, with one crucial extra
property that a classic parameter server lacks: a *commit history*.  That extra
semantics is exactly what makes rebase / staleness handling possible (design
doc, section 1, precision boundary #1).

Concretely:

* Each artifact is stored as a JSON blob under ``artifacts/<id>.json`` in a real
  git repository.
* A per-artifact integer version is kept in ``versions.json`` and bumped on every
  commit that touches the artifact.  The collection of these integers is the
  *version vector* that diffs are stamped against.
* Two branches exist: ``dev`` (fast branch, absorbs everything that passes the
  statistical test) and ``stable`` (slow branch, an EMA-style confirmation of
  dev -- design doc, section 4.5).
* Commits use compare-and-swap: a writer declares the base version it read, and
  the commit is rejected if the head has moved past it.  Multi-artifact
  contract-breaking diffs commit atomically (2PC-style: stage all, then a single
  git commit).

Because AgentDescent's reference implementation runs the workers in-process, the
git operations are serialized through a single lock; the CAS check is what makes
the *logical* concurrency safe.
