"""The ERA port's AlgoTune task: the derivation, the gate, the runner, the score.

The block that matters most is the first one. Everything else here checks that
the machinery does what it says; ``test_the_derived_program_computes_what_the_
reference_computes`` checks that the *benchmark* is right, because a speedup
measured against a reference that is not the task's reference is a measurement
of nothing.

Offline, like the rest of the suite: the task file, its description and
upstream's published problem sizes are all served from fixtures here, and the
one test that reaches the real network is skipped unless it is asked for.
