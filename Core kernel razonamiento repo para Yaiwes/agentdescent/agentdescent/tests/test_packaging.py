"""What a `pip install agentdescent` actually gives you.

Checked by installing the built wheel into a fresh venv outside the repo: the
library imports and works, the dataloader caches under ~/.cache (not the repo),
but `examples/` is deliberately NOT shipped -- while README and docs contain ~30
`python -m examples.…` commands. That mismatch is a first-hour failure for anyone
who follows the install instructions, so the docs must say a checkout is needed.
