"""Three RL decision rules, and the guards that keep them honest.

None of these tests claim the mechanisms *work*. That is what an A/B on a real
dataset is for, and until one has run, each of these is an option and not a
mechanism -- which is why the tests below also pin that installing none of them
changes nothing.

What is checked here is the part an A/B cannot check: that `None` never
masquerades as a measurement, that the adaptive region moves for the right reason
and stops at its bounds, and that the stable-distance penalty refuses a commit
rather than quietly editing the score it was judged on.
