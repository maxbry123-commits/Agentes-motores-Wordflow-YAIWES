"""What `import agentdescent` gives you, and whether the docs agree with it.

`__init__.py` curates a large `__all__`, and the project's own documentation
almost never used it -- 63 submodule imports against 3 top-level ones, with
`evolve` never once shown as `from agentdescent import evolve`. So the top-level
surface was untested by usage, and it showed: a documented helper missing from it
(`tasks_from`, which the quickstart tells you to import from
`agentdescent.evolution`), the whole `ContractError` hierarchy unreachable
although `evolve`'s docstring tells callers to distinguish it from a backend
failure, and two classes exported that cannot be constructed from the public API.
