"""`dev -> stable` promotion must reward an artifact for *holding up*.

The counter was bumped on the commit path, so it measured how many times an
artifact had **changed** -- the opposite of what every description of it says
("survival rounds", "regression-free rounds", "EMA confirmation rounds"). The
incentive was inverted: an artifact that converged stopped committing and could
therefore never be promoted, while one that thrashed promoted every K commits.

`python -m examples.run_demo` showed it plainly -- `stable` sat at 0.000 for all
40 rounds while `dev` reached 1.000 by round 3 -- and nothing caught it, because
`run_demo` is one of the examples with no test at all.
