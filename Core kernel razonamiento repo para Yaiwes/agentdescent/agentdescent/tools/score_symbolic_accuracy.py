"""Score an LLM-SRBench run's **symbolic accuracy**, the paper's third metric.

    python -m tools.score_symbolic_accuracy RESULT.json --provider claude \\
        --model glm-5.2 --yes

The two metrics an LLM-SRBench run reports on its own -- ``Acc(0.1)`` and NMSE --
are data fidelity: they ask whether the answer *predicts* the held-out samples.
Symbolic accuracy asks whether it **is the equation**, and it is the column that
separates discovering a law from interpolating one. Measured on this port's own
answers, that distinction is not academic: the whole-category protocol returns
nine-term library fits that reach NMSE 1e-13 on truths of two terms.

It is a separate tool rather than part of a run for three reasons. It needs the
**ground truth**, which must never come near the search. It needs a model call
per problem, which a sandboxed evaluator cannot make. And it should be
re-runnable with a different judge against an unchanged result file, because the
judge is part of the metric.

How faithful this is
--------------------
The paper (arXiv:2504.10415, §3) specifies the metric but its prompt lives in an
appendix figure that the arXiv HTML render does not carry, so the prompt below
is written to the paper's description rather than transcribed from it:

    "GPT-4o evaluates mathematical equivalence by comparing the symbolic form of
    the predicted hypothesis versus the ground-truth equation after removing
    parameters and constants."

Two further deviations, both stated in the output file:

* **The judge is not GPT-4o.** It is whatever ``--model`` names. A different
  judge is a different metric, so a number from here sits beside the paper's
  with that said, not inside its table.
* **Not every problem can be scored.** 36 ``chem_react`` and 44 ``phys_osc``
  ground truths are damaged in the published copy this port reads -- a mangled
  constant, and symbolic templates with unbound parameters -- so they are
  reported as ``not_scorable`` rather than guessed at. That leaves 49 of 129
  LSR-Synth problems and all 111 LSR-Transform problems.

Before the judge is asked, a **deterministic check** runs: both sides have their
numeric literals replaced by free symbols and sympy is asked whether the
difference simplifies to zero. Where that settles the question it is used
directly and the judge is not called -- an exact answer beats a probable one,
and it puts a floor under the metric that does not depend on any model.
