# Repo-OS Contract

The **repo-OS contract** is the set of on-disk artifacts a loop-engineer scaffolds into a
workspace so that an agent loop can be designed, launched, verified, repaired, resumed across
sessions, and improved — *without* the loop's state living only in a chat context that
compaction or a crashed session can lose. State is **externalized to files**; the loop reads
its truth from disk on every turn.

This file is the canonical schema. It is scaffolded by `[[loop-contract]]`, consumed by
`[[loop-run]]` (which transitions `state.json`), repaired by `[[loop-repair]]`, measured by
`[[loop-evals]]`, and mined by `[[loop-flywheel]]`. The patterns that drive each artifact live
in `loop-patterns.md`; the safety/terminal semantics live in `safety-and-approvals.md`.

---

## 0. The contract is a versioned, tool-agnostic standard

This document is the **normative standard** for the repo-OS contract. It is not a
description of one tool's private file format: it is a **portable, tool-agnostic on-disk
standard**. Any surface that can read a repo, run a shell command, and write files can emit or
consume it — Loop Engineer is the *reference implementation*, not the only permitted producer.

- **Conformance is defined by the published JSON Schemas** in `schemas/*.schema.json`, not by
  any one validator's source code. Every schema-bearing artifact carries a `schema` key, and
  every schema an `$id`, of the form **`loop-engineer/<artifact>@<major>`**
  (e.g. `loop-engineer/state@1`). The major integer in that identifier is the version an
  external emitter targets.
- **Within a major, changes are strictly additive and optional.** Every artifact schema sets
  `"additionalProperties": true`, so a validator for major *N* accepts any artifact whose
  required keys and types match major *N* and **ignores unknown keys** — a newer emitter's
  extra fields never reject a valid v1 artifact. Adding an optional key, or a new optional
  file, does not bump the major.
- **Breaking changes get a new major and a new `$id`.** Removing or renaming a required key,
  changing a type, or tightening an enum ships as `loop-engineer/<artifact>@2` with a new
  `$id`. Both majors may be published and validated **side by side**.
- **Stability tiers.** The artifact table (§11) records each artifact's tier. For v1:
  **manifest / state / tasks / terminal are `stable`**; **receipt / repair-record /
  rollout-record are `provisional`** (the newest surfaces, whose additive shape may still be
  refined within `@1`).

A third-party harness whose output satisfies the §14 conformance checklist may claim it
**"emits a Loop-Engineer-conformant contract v1."**

## 1. The full repo-OS tree

```
<workspace>/
  AGENTS.md           # short table-of-contents of stable rules (points to the rest)
  SPEC.md             # success criteria, constraints, non-goals, evidence rules — the INTENT
  WORKFLOW.md         # loop policy, approval gates, budgets, terminal states — the STABLE RULES
  TASKS.json          # machine-readable task ledger — the QUEUE
  RUNLOG.md           # human-readable iteration history (one entry per loop) — the HISTORY
  EVALS/
    dataset/          # fixed eval inputs (golden cases, hidden canaries)
    rubrics/          # model-judge rubrics (fixed schema per artifact type)
    regressions/      # trace-derived regression cases harvested from failures
    traces/           # captured run traces (for loop-behavior analysis)
  scripts/
    verify-fast       # deterministic, cheap gate (tests/lint/typecheck subset) — blocking
    verify-full       # full deterministic gate — blocking
    verify-safety     # red-team / approval / injection checks — blocking
    judge-rubric      # rubric model-judge harness — advisory
    extract-trace-metrics  # turns traces into the loop-behavior + cost metrics
  .loop/
    state.json        # machine status: the live FSM cursor — the SOURCE OF MACHINE TRUTH
    terminal_state.json    # written exactly once, at loop end
    checkpoints/      # point-in-time snapshots of best-known-good state
    artifacts/        # intermediate work products (drafts, generated files)
    approvals/        # one file per approval request + its resolution
    repair/           # repair@1 records — scanned by doctor when present
    receipts/         # receipt@1 ledgers (*.jsonl) — scanned by doctor when present
    evidence/         # evidence@1 records — the declared location doctor scans (§17)
    memory/
      session-summary.md   # short-term: continue-this-run compaction summary (disposable at terminal)
      lessons.md           # long-term: durable lessons that improve future runs
```

Every artifact has exactly one owner concern (see §9). The split is deliberate: a turn that
needs "what does done mean" reads `SPEC.md`; a turn that needs "where am I" reads
`.loop/state.json`; neither file is overloaded with the other's job.

---

## 2. `AGENTS.md` — stable rules table-of-contents

**Purpose.** A *short* index the agent reads first every session. It does not contain the rules
themselves beyond a one-line each; it points at `SPEC.md`, `WORKFLOW.md`, and `scripts/`. This is
the engine-neutral entry point — the same file Codex Goal mode and Google Conductor read (see
`platform-map.md`), which is why the contract names it `AGENTS.md` rather than a Claude-specific
name.

**Minimal schema (Markdown, fixed section order):**

```markdown
# AGENTS — <project>
- **Intent:** see SPEC.md (success criteria + non-goals)
- **Loop policy:** see WORKFLOW.md (gates, budgets, terminal states, repair cap)
- **Verify:** scripts/verify-fast (cheap), scripts/verify-full, scripts/verify-safety
- **Task queue:** TASKS.json   **History:** RUNLOG.md   **Live state:** .loop/state.json
- **Resume rule:** if .loop/state.json exists, skip intake; continue from first incomplete state.
```

Keep it under ~20 lines. If it grows, the depth belongs in the file it points to.

---

## 3. `SPEC.md` — intent

**Purpose.** The single source of *what done means*. It is the contract against which every
verification and the prime directive are judged: if `SPEC.md` cannot state success, verification,
or a terminal condition, the loop is **underspecified** and terminates `FailedSpecGap` rather than
declaring the next completion "done." This is the primary defense against the documented #1
long-horizon failure mode — false completion / weak self-verification.

**Minimal schema (Markdown, fixed sections):**

| Section | Content |
|---|---|
| `## Goal` | One paragraph: the objective in outcome terms. |
| `## Success Criteria` | Numbered, each *independently checkable* (maps to a `verify-*` check or eval case). |
| `## Constraints` | Hard limits (perf, deps, files-not-to-touch, style). |
| `## Non-Goals` | Explicit out-of-scope (YAGNI fence). |
| `## Evidence Rules` | What counts as proof a criterion is met (which `scripts/verify-*` / which `EVALS/` case). No criterion without a stated evidence source. |

A `## Success Criteria` line with no corresponding evidence rule is itself a spec gap.

---

## 4. `WORKFLOW.md` — stable loop rules

**Purpose.** The loop's operating policy — separate from intent because it changes on a different
cadence (you tune gates and budgets far more often than you redefine success). Read by
`[[loop-run]]` to know how to behave and by `[[loop-repair]]` to read the repair cap.

**Minimal schema (Markdown, fixed sections):**

| Section | Content |
|---|---|
| `## Loop` | The state sequence: `intake → plan → critique-plan → queue-tasks → execute-task → verify → (repair | replan | approval-wait) → terminal`. |
| `## Approval Gates` | The side-effect boundaries that pause for approval (destructive commands, secret access, production changes, money movement, policy-sensitive output) and the `approval_policy` in force (`never` / `on_side_effects` / `strict`). |
| `## Budgets` | `time_budget`, `cost_budget` and the rule: exhausted budget → `FailedBudget`. |
| `## Repair Cap` | `max_repair_attempts` (default **2**), and what happens at the cap: replan / revert / approve / terminate. |
| `## Terminal States` | All **7**, verbatim, each with its trigger (see §8). |
| `## Dispatch` | Routing rule: every dispatched agent / Workflow `agent()` names an explicit `model:` (read→haiku, reason→sonnet, write→opus); the receipts each dispatch appends land in `.loop/receipts/*.jsonl` (schema: `schemas/receipt.schema.json`). |

`WORKFLOW.md` states policy; it never records run status — that is `.loop/state.json`'s job.

---

## 5. `TASKS.json` — the machine-readable task ledger

**Purpose.** The queue the loop executes against, machine-readable so `[[loop-run]]` can pick the
next task deterministically and `extract-trace-metrics` can count progress. Distinct from
`SPEC.md` (intent) and `RUNLOG.md` (narrative history): this is current queue *status*.

**Minimal schema (JSON — `tasks` is an ordered array; each task object):**

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | Stable task id (e.g. `T1`). |
| `title` | string | One-line description. |
| `status` | enum | `pending` \| `active` \| `blocked` \| `done` \| `abandoned`. |
| `criterion_ref` | string | The `SPEC.md` success-criterion number this task advances. |
| `verify` | string | The exact command/check that proves this task done (a `scripts/verify-*` invocation or eval case). |
| `depends_on` | string[] | Task ids that must be `done` first. |
| `attempts` | int | Times executed (drives repair-cap accounting). |
| `evidence` | string\|null | Path/ref to the verification bundle proving `done`; null until proven. |

```json
{
  "schema": "loop-engineer/tasks@1",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "T1",
      "title": "Add input validation to pricing.parse_request",
      "status": "done",
      "criterion_ref": "2",
      "verify": "scripts/verify-fast",
      "depends_on": [],
      "attempts": 1,
      "evidence": ".loop/artifacts/verify-T1.json"
    },
    {
      "id": "T2",
      "title": "Raise pricing.py coverage to >=80%",
      "status": "active",
      "criterion_ref": "1",
      "verify": "scripts/verify-full",
      "depends_on": ["T1"],
      "attempts": 2,
      "evidence": null
    }
  ]
}
```

A task is only `done` when `evidence` is non-null *and* its `verify` passed — never on the
agent's assertion alone.

---

## 6. `RUNLOG.md` — human-readable iteration history

**Purpose.** The append-only narrative of what each loop iteration did — for a human reviewer and
for `[[loop-flywheel]]` to mine into regression cases. One entry per loop iteration; entries are
never edited, only appended (immutable history).

**Minimal schema (Markdown — one block per iteration, fixed fields):**

```markdown
## Iteration <n> — <ISO-8601 timestamp>
- **state:** <FSM state this iteration ran>
- **active_task:** <TASKS.json id>
- **action:** <what was attempted, 1–2 lines>
- **dispatch:** <agent/model used, e.g. engineer @ opus> | none
- **verify:** <command> → PASS | FAIL (<which criteria>)
- **score:** <best_score before → after> (deterministic and/or rubric)
- **outcome:** advanced | repaired | replanned | approval-wait | terminal:<state>
- **evidence:** <path to verification bundle>
```

Per-iteration fields (`state`, `active_task`, `action`, `dispatch`, `verify`, `score`,
`outcome`, `evidence`) are required so a trace transform can parse the log mechanically.

---

## 7. `.loop/state.json` — the live FSM cursor

**Purpose.** The **source of machine truth** for resume. Serialized after *every* state
transition so a fresh session reconstitutes the loop exactly: the resume rule is — if
`state.json` exists, skip intake and continue from the first incomplete state. This is the
file-backed realization of a portable Python FSM spine pattern (init / next / complete +
serialize-after-transition; ~100 lines); the loop-engineer does **not** ship a new spine — when the
Python-FSM realization is chosen, implement the ~100-line pattern or reuse the author's
`harmony-agent` `engine/cli.py` reference impl.

**Minimal schema (JSON — fields are the spec's State row):**

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `iteration_id` | int | Monotonic loop counter (matches latest `RUNLOG` entry). |
| `state` | enum | Current FSM state: `intake`, `plan`, `critique-plan`, `queue-tasks`, `execute-task`, `verify`, `repair`, `replan`, `approval-wait`, or `terminal`. `loop/fsm.py` is normative for the transition table. |
| `updated_at` | string\|null | ISO-8601 UTC timestamp of the last write by a `loop.emit` writer; additive/optional and absent on legacy artifacts. |
| `plan_version` | int | Bumped on every replan (lets traces detect churn). |
| `active_task` | string\|null | `TASKS.json` id currently in flight. |
| `best_score` | number\|null | Best verification score so far (repair productivity is measured against this). |
| `failure_mode` | string\|null | Classified failure of the last failed verify (drives `[[loop-repair]]`). |
| `pending_approval` | string\|null | `.loop/approvals/` filename if paused at a gate, else null. |
| `budget_remaining` | object | `{ "time": <unit>, "cost": <unit> }`; hitting zero → `FailedBudget`. |
| `checkpoint_path` | string\|null | Latest `.loop/checkpoints/` snapshot (best-known-good to revert to). |
| `terminal_state` | string\|null | Null while running; set to one of the 7 at end. |

```json
{
  "schema": "loop-engineer/state@1",
  "iteration_id": 2,
  "state": "repair",
  "plan_version": 1,
  "active_task": "T2",
  "best_score": 0.74,
  "failure_mode": "deterministic-fail",
  "pending_approval": null,
  "budget_remaining": { "time": "18m", "cost": "0.62usd" },
  "checkpoint_path": ".loop/checkpoints/iter1-good.json",
  "terminal_state": null
}
```

`pending_approval` is how an approval gate pauses *and resumes from the same run state* — the gate
sets it; resolution clears it; the loop never spawns a fresh untracked attempt (see
`safety-and-approvals.md`).

---

## 8. `terminal_state.json` — the single end record

**Purpose.** Written exactly once, when the loop reaches a terminal state. It is the definitive
"how did this loop end" record — no silent "completed." Its `state` MUST be one of the canonical
**7 terminal states (verbatim):**

`Succeeded`, `FailedUnverifiable`, `FailedBlocked`, `FailedBudget`, `FailedSafety`,
`FailedSpecGap`, `AbortedByHuman`.

| Terminal state | Fires when |
|---|---|
| `Succeeded` | All `SPEC.md` success criteria verified with evidence. |
| `FailedUnverifiable` | Work seems done but no `verify-*`/eval can prove it (cannot confirm success). |
| `FailedBlocked` | A hard external blocker (missing dep, unavailable system) the loop cannot clear. |
| `FailedBudget` | `time_budget` or `cost_budget` exhausted before success. |
| `FailedSafety` | Policy/safety risk, or detected verifier-gaming → hard-terminate + logged as a security failure. |
| `FailedSpecGap` | Success / verification / terminal condition could not be defined (underspecified — the prime directive). |
| `AbortedByHuman` | A human stopped the run (e.g. declined an approval and chose to abort). |

**Minimal schema (JSON):**

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `state` | enum | One of the 7 above. |
| `iteration_id` | int | Final iteration count. |
| `terminated_at` | string | ISO-8601 UTC timestamp stamped by `loop.emit.terminate()`; additive/optional, so legacy records without it remain valid. |
| `criteria_met` | object | `{ "<criterion#>": true\|false }` for every `SPEC.md` criterion. |
| `completion_policy` | object | Completion rule for the criteria map. v1 supports `{ "mode": "all_required" }`; legacy records without the field are interpreted the same way. Optional (additive). Note: a pre-migration `Succeeded` record whose criteria map contains any `false` value fails this rule and needs re-verification. |
| `evidence` | string[] | Paths to the verification bundles backing the verdict. |
| `false_completion` | bool | True if the loop had earlier *claimed* success that verification later refuted (feeds the false-completion-rate metric). |
| `reason` | string | One line: why this terminal state, especially for any `Failed*`/`Aborted*`. |
| `lessons_ref` | string\|null | Path into `.loop/memory/` long-term lessons for `[[loop-flywheel]]`. |

```json
{
  "schema": "loop-engineer/terminal@1",
  "state": "Succeeded",
  "iteration_id": 2,
  "criteria_met": { "1": true, "2": true },
  "completion_policy": { "mode": "all_required" },
  "evidence": [".loop/artifacts/verify-T2.json", ".loop/artifacts/verify-T1.json"],
  "false_completion": false,
  "reason": "All SPEC criteria verified: coverage 0.83 >= 0.80; validation tests pass.",
  "lessons_ref": ".loop/memory/lessons.md"
}
```

---

## 9. Separation-of-concerns rationale

The artifacts are deliberately partitioned so that **no file carries two jobs** and each can
evolve on its own cadence:

| Concern | Owner | Why isolated |
|---|---|---|
| **Stable rules** | `AGENTS.md`, `WORKFLOW.md` | Policy changes (gates/budgets) churn far more than intent; keep them out of `SPEC.md`. |
| **Intent** | `SPEC.md` | The success contract is the one thing every verification judges against — it must be unambiguous and not buried under loop mechanics. |
| **Machine status** | `TASKS.json`, `.loop/state.json` | Read/written every turn by code; machine-readable and small so resume is deterministic and cheap. |
| **History** | `RUNLOG.md` | Append-only narrative — separating it from live state keeps `state.json` tiny and lets the flywheel mine a clean log. |
| **Proof** | `scripts/verify-*`, `EVALS/`, `terminal_state.json` | Verification must be *independent* of the agent's self-report; the proof surface is its own files so success is established by evidence, not assertion. |

Three properties fall out of this split:

1. **Resumability.** Because machine truth lives in `.loop/state.json` (not chat context), any
   session — even a different engine — reconstitutes the loop from disk. Compaction or a crash
   loses no loop state.
2. **Verifiability over assertion.** Intent (`SPEC.md`) and proof (`scripts/verify-*`,
   `terminal_state.json`) are separate files owned by separate spokes (`loop-contract` writes
   intent; `loop-evals` writes proof), so "done" is always evidence-backed — the structural guard
   against false completion.
3. **Portability.** The contract is plain Markdown + JSON + shell, engine-neutral by
   construction. `AGENTS.md` is the shared entry point and the same artifacts map onto Codex,
   Hermes, and Google surfaces (see `platform-map.md`); v1 specifies the contract, not a live
   cross-engine runner.

---

## 10. YAML skill-manifest example

A loop *declares* its operating contract explicitly (never in prose). This manifest is the
machine-readable face of the inputs/outputs/policies/terminal-states the contract enforces; a
loop-engineer emits it alongside the scaffold so the interface contract is checkable, not implied.

```yaml
# .loop/manifest.yaml — the explicit operating contract for one loop
loop: pricing-coverage-and-validation
schema: loop-engineer/manifest@1

inputs:
  goal: "Bring pricing.py to >=80% coverage and add input validation."
  success_criteria:
    - "1: pricing.py line coverage >= 80% (scripts/verify-full)"
    - "2: parse_request rejects malformed input with a typed error (scripts/verify-fast)"
  constraints:
    - "Do not modify existing public function signatures."
    - "No new third-party dependencies."
  workspace_path: "./"
  allowed_tools: [read, workspace-write]      # NOT network, NOT external-side-effects
  risk_profile: low                           # low | med | high
  time_budget: "30m"
  cost_budget: "1.00usd"
  approval_policy: on_side_effects            # never | on_side_effects | strict

outputs:
  plan: SPEC.md
  task_queue: TASKS.json
  current_state: .loop/state.json
  verification_bundle: .loop/artifacts/
  repair_actions: .loop/repair/<iteration_id>.json
  terminal_state: .loop/terminal_state.json
  lessons_learned: .loop/memory/lessons.md

permissions:                                  # least-privilege tiers
  - read-only
  - workspace-write
  # network / external-side-effects / production-mutation are OFF for this loop

approval_gates:                               # each pauses-and-resumes from run state
  - destructive_commands
  - secret_access
  - production_changes

policies:
  repair_cap: 2                               # then replan | revert | approve | terminate
  plan_then_execute: false                    # set true for untrusted/web environments
  verifier_gaming: hard_terminate_as_security_failure

terminal_states:                              # the canonical 7, verbatim
  - Succeeded
  - FailedUnverifiable
  - FailedBlocked
  - FailedBudget
  - FailedSafety
  - FailedSpecGap
  - AbortedByHuman
```

The `inputs`/`outputs`/`permissions`/`approval_gates`/`terminal_states` keys mirror the spec's
interface-contract table directly; `[[loop-contract]]` scaffolds this manifest from the
architecture decision record that `[[loop-architect]]` emits.

---

## 11. Artifact & schema reference

Every schema-bearing artifact in the contract, its on-disk location, the schema that defines it,
its embedded `$id`, its **required keys** (read verbatim from `schemas/*.schema.json` — an
emitter MUST supply all of them), its lifecycle role, and its stability tier (§0). Required keys
are the floor; `additionalProperties: true` means an artifact may carry more.

| Artifact | Contract path | Schema file | `$id` | Required keys | Lifecycle role | Tier |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| manifest | `.loop/manifest.yaml` | `schemas/manifest.schema.json` | `loop-engineer/manifest@1` | `schema`, `loop`, `policies`, `terminal_states` | The explicit, machine-readable operating contract for one loop (§10). | **stable** |
| state | `.loop/state.json` | `schemas/state.schema.json` | `loop-engineer/state@1` | `schema`, `iteration_id`, `state`, `plan_version`, `budget_remaining` | The live FSM cursor — the source of machine truth for resume (§7). | **stable** |
| tasks | `TASKS.json` *(workspace root)* | `schemas/tasks.schema.json` | `loop-engineer/tasks@1` | `schema`, `tasks`; each task: `id`, `title`, `status`, `criterion_ref`, `verify`, `depends_on`, `attempts`, `evidence` | The machine-readable task queue (§5). | **stable** |
| terminal | `.loop/terminal_state.json` | `schemas/terminal.schema.json` | `loop-engineer/terminal@1` | `schema`, `state`, `criteria_met`, `evidence`, `false_completion` | The single end record, written once at loop end (§8). | **stable** |
| receipt | `.loop/receipts/*.jsonl` | `schemas/receipt.schema.json` | `loop-engineer/receipt@1` | `schema`, `iteration_id`, `role`, `model`, `outcome` | Append-one-per-line dispatch/cost trail (role vs model, cost-per-success). | *provisional* |
| repair-record | `.loop/repair/<iteration_id>.json` | `schemas/repair-record.schema.json` | `loop-engineer/repair@1` | `schema`, `iteration_id`, `attempt`, `failure_mode`, `hypothesis`, `repair_action`, `verification_before`, `verification_after`, `remaining_delta`, `productive` | One bounded repair pass (diagnosis shape); the canonical repair-productivity input (§13). | *provisional* |
| rollout-record | `.loop/rollout.jsonl` | `schemas/rollout-record.schema.json` | `loop-engineer/rollout@1` | `id`, `parent`, `verdict`, `score`, `score_delta`, `coherent_with_prior_winner`, `productive` | One candidate adjudication in a rollout / genetic-hardening ledger (§13). | *provisional* |

The rollout-record's required set is the only one that does **not** require a `schema` envelope
key (the ledger writer today emits bare records); the schema permits one via
`additionalProperties`, but does not demand it. `doctor` validates receipts and repair/rollout
records **only when the files are present** (§14 C1–C3): an in-flight loop that has not yet
produced a trail still conforms.

---

## 12. Lifecycle vocabulary

The 7 terminal states (§8) are the **frozen** set of ways a loop *ends*. Before it ends, a loop
also holds non-terminal lifecycle values while it is *scaffolded but not started* or *running*.
These non-terminal values are **not** terminal states and never appear in the 7-member
`terminal_state` enum. Two rules make an in-flight loop a first-class, conformant state.

### 12.1 The terminal-file-iff rule

`terminal_state.json` is required **iff** `state.json`'s `terminal_state` is non-null.

- While `state.json` reports `terminal_state: null`, the **absence** of `.loop/terminal_state.json`
  is **conformant** — the loop is in-flight, not failing validation. (`validate_contract` gates
  the terminal-file read on `state.terminal_state`; a null with no file is treated as an
  in-flight loop, not a `missing_file` issue.)
- A non-null `terminal_state` **without** the terminal file is a `missing_file` failure.

**Why the iff, not "always require a terminal file":** a gate that demands a terminal record from
a live loop pushes an operator to *write a terminal state onto a loop that has not terminated* —
a fabricated end record. That is exactly the false completion this contract exists to prevent.
The iff rule removes the incentive: an honest in-flight loop is green without inventing an ending.

### 12.2 The `doctor` lifecycle line

`doctor` (`validate_contract`) adds a `lifecycle` field to its report so an operator sees *why*
no terminal file is expected. It is derived (total and pure — never an issue source) as:

1. **`terminated:<X>`** — if `state.json` parsed with a non-null `terminal_state`, **or**
   `.loop/terminal_state.json` exists. `<X>` is the terminal file's `state` value when the file
   parses to a dict with a string `state`; else `state.json`'s `terminal_state` when that is a
   string; else `unknown`.
2. **`planned`** — else, if `state.json` parsed and its `iteration_id` is `0` (or `"0"`):
   scaffolded, not yet run.
3. **`running`** — else, if `state.json` parsed: executing.
4. **`unknown`** — else (no parseable `state.json`).

`planned`, `running`, and `unknown` are lifecycle-report values only; none is a terminal state,
and no terminal state ever surfaces as one of them. The `terminated:<X>` form is the only overlap
point, and there `<X>` is always drawn from the frozen 7 (or `unknown`).

---

## 13. Two distinct record shapes — repair-record vs rollout-record

The repair-record and the rollout-record are **different artifacts** that share only a
`productive` boolean; they must not be conflated (this section exists so no one conflates them
again). They differ in shape, location, and what `productive` measures:

| | repair-record (`loop-engineer/repair@1`) | rollout-record (`loop-engineer/rollout@1`) |
|---|---|---|
| **Shape** | **Diagnosis** of one bounded repair pass | **Ledger** entry adjudicating one rollout candidate |
| **Location** | `.loop/repair/<iteration_id>.json` (one JSON object per file) | `.loop/rollout.jsonl` (append one JSON object per line) |
| **Key fields** | `failure_mode`, `hypothesis`, `repair_action`, `verification_before`, `verification_after`, `remaining_delta`, `productive` | `id`, `parent`, `verdict`, `score`, `score_delta`, `coherent_with_prior_winner`, `productive` |
| **`productive` means** | repair-productivity: `verification_after.score > verification_before.score` | rollout-productivity: `score_delta` is not null and `> 0` |
| **Feeds** | the repair-productivity metric / baseline (`loop-repair`) | the flywheel's candidate-hardening view (`loop-flywheel`) |

The repair-record is the diagnosis shape the repair skill prescribes and the eval structural
invariant pins; the rollout-record is genome/candidate bookkeeping. Publishing them as two `$id`s
resolves the historic "two 7-field shapes both called *the* repair record" ambiguity.

## 14. Conformance checklist

A harness that satisfies **every** item below may claim it **"emits a Loop-Engineer-conformant
contract v1."** Each item is a third-party-checkable statement against the published schemas.
Items **C1–C3 are checked-when-present** — an in-flight loop that has not yet emitted a receipt,
repair, or rollout trail still conforms. `scripts/test_conformance.py` executes this checklist in
CI against the flagship example ([`examples/coverage-repair`](../examples/coverage-repair)) and a
fresh template scaffold, so a drift between this doc, the schemas, and the shipped scaffold cannot
land silently.

**A. Artifacts present & well-formed**
- **A1** — `.loop/manifest.yaml` validates against `loop-engineer/manifest@1` (including the
  canonical 7 `terminal_states`, verbatim and in order).
- **A2** — `.loop/state.json` validates against `loop-engineer/state@1`.
- **A3** — `TASKS.json` validates against `loop-engineer/tasks@1`; no duplicate task ids; no task
  marked `done` without `evidence`.
- **A4** — `RUNLOG.md` is present.

**B. Lifecycle honesty**
- **B1** — Exactly one of: (`state.terminal_state` is null **and** no `terminal_state.json`) **or**
  (`terminal_state` is one of the canonical 7 **and** `terminal_state.json` is present and valid).
- **B2** — `terminal_state.json`, when present, validates against `loop-engineer/terminal@1` with a
  `criteria_met` object, an `evidence` list, and an explicit `false_completion` boolean; a
  `Succeeded` terminal additionally has `false_completion=false`, every declared criterion true
  under `completion_policy.mode=all_required` (legacy records without the field are interpreted
  the same way), and non-empty `evidence`.

**C. Evidentiary trail (checked when present)**
- **C1** — every `.loop/receipts/*.jsonl` line validates against `loop-engineer/receipt@1`.
- **C2** — every `.loop/repair/*.json` validates against `loop-engineer/repair@1`.
- **C3** — `.loop/rollout.jsonl`, when present, validates against `loop-engineer/rollout@1`.

**D. Versioning**
- **D1** — every artifact's `schema` key names a published, current-major schema `$id`.
- **D2** — unknown keys are tolerated (additive fields never reject a v1 artifact).

**E. Lifecycle report**
- **E1** — `doctor` reports a `lifecycle` value consistent with B1: `terminated:<state>` iff the
  terminal pair is present and valid; `planned` / `running` otherwise (§12.2).

## 15. `loop-engineer/plan@1` — the Loop Plan IR

`schemas/plan.schema.json` defines a canonical, validated description of a
goal, its tasks, and its policies — the document a future execution runtime
interprets (ADR 0001). It is authored and linted as a **standalone JSON
file**, validated by `loop plan-lint <file>` / `loop.plan.validate_plan()`.

**Scope boundary:** unlike manifest/state/tasks/terminal (§11), plan@1 is
**not yet** an artifact `loop doctor` reads from a scaffolded workspace —
it has no `.loop/`-relative home today. The execution-runtime milestone
that materializes a plan into a live `TASKS.json` will make that call.

**Task kinds:** `agent | tool | gate | approval | join | subloop | human |
terminal` — each carries a common `id`/`kind`/`title`/`depends_on` base
plus kind-specific required fields (`loop/plan.py::_KIND_REQUIRED_FIELDS`).

**Capability-based model policy** (issue #56, ADR 0001 consequence 5): an
optional top-level `model_policy` maps roles (`read`/`reason`/`write`/
`verify`) to capabilities (`fast_low_cost`/`deep_reasoning`/
`code_generation`/`independent_review`) — never a vendor model name. An
`agent`-kind task declares a `role`; a provider profile resolves the
capability to an actual model **outside** the portable contract, recorded
to a receipt for reproducibility, not to the plan.

**Cross-field rules JSON Schema cannot express** (enforced by
`loop/plan.py`, in both validation modes): task-id and
acceptance-criteria-id uniqueness, dangling `depends_on`/`join_on`
references, dependency-graph acyclicity, per-kind required fields, and
`approval_gates` referential integrity.

Golden examples: `examples/plans/coverage-repair.plan.json` (valid, all 8
kinds); `examples/plans/invalid/` (deliberately broken fixtures used by
the negative tests).

## 16. `loop-engineer/event@1` — EventStore + deterministic reducer

`schemas/event.schema.json` defines one immutable, append-only fact in a run's
event log (ADR 0001). `loop.events.SQLiteEventStore` persists events in a
SQLite database in WAL mode with `synchronous=FULL` (every committed `append()`
survives a crash) and DB-level `BEFORE UPDATE`/`BEFORE DELETE` triggers that
refuse mutation or removal of a committed row **through the store API**,
regardless of caller; a process with direct write access to the database file
can `DROP TRIGGER` — the triggers are an anti-footgun, not a security control
(see Integrity boundary).
`loop.reducer.reduce_events()` is a pure, resumable left-fold that projects an
ordered event stream into a deterministic state/runlog/receipts view — the
same input sequence always produces a byte-identical result.

**Scope boundary:** `loop doctor` reads `event@1` when `.loop/events.db`
exists (§22) by composing the exact `status`/`replay` read-only verbs, not by
duplicating their logic; an absent store is conformant and adds no issues
(§12.1's terminal-file-iff rule has an analogous "absent is fine" shape). One
run is discovered per store; multi-run support remains deferred.

**Dispatch crash boundary:** `loop run` verifies first, then commits its
`iteration_appended` (or `terminal_written`) event with a compare-and-swap
sequence. That committed event is the source of truth; only afterwards are
`RUNLOG.md` and `.loop/state.json` materialized from the exact recorded
payload. A later `loop run` replays missing legacy materialization before
selecting work, so a crash after the event commit never duplicates a dispatch.
TASKS.json is read-only declarative input for dispatch: event-log
`task_passed` facts supply dynamic completion and dispatch does not rewrite
task status or evidence.

**Verifier isolation:** A declared task verifier runs through
`subprocess.run(shell=False, cwd=workspace, timeout=...)`, so it receives an
argv rather than shell-interpreted input and cannot share the runner process.
A timeout or nonzero exit becomes `VerifyOutcome(False, ...)`, never an
exception. `VerifierExecutionError`, `VerifierNotImplementedError`, and
`RunModeNotImplementedError` are the typed cases where dispatch could not be
attempted.

**Event types:** `contract_opened | iteration_appended | receipt_appended |
terminal_written | terminal_superseded | approval_requested |
approval_resolved | run_paused | run_resumed` — nine members, matching
`loop.events.EVENT_TYPES` and the `type` enum of `schemas/event.schema.json`.
The **first four** correspond to `loop.emit`'s writer operations
(`open_contract`/`append_iteration`/`append_receipt`/`terminate`), so a
future write-through migration targets an already-matching payload shape. The
remaining five have no `emit` writer by design: `terminal_superseded` is the
administrative correction of §18, and the four run-control types are §19's
projection primitives.

**Two-layer enforcement, deliberately split:** the store validates event@1
envelope/payload *shape* only (`loop/events.py::validate_event`, both
validation modes, both type-checked in structural fallback); the reducer
enforces *domain* semantics at replay time — FSM transition legality
(`loop.fsm.is_legal_transition`), G1 completion
(`loop.completion.criteria_satisfy_completion`), and terminal immutability
(no event may follow a `terminal_written`) — reusing the exact functions
`loop.contract`/`loop.emit` already enforce at file-write time, never
re-implemented. A store back-end therefore never needs domain awareness to be
conformant; the reducer is a second, independent enforcement point that a
tampered or foreign-sourced event stream still cannot talk past **without
constructing a stream that is itself FSM-legal, G1-satisfying and
hash-chain-consistent; a determined in-workspace rewriter can construct one —
see Integrity boundary.**

### Hash chain (v0.10.0+)

`event@1` carries two **additive, optional** fields: `prev_event_hash` — the
immediately preceding event's `event_hash` within the same run, `null` at
genesis — and `event_hash`, this event's own digest. Both are
`["string", "null"]` constrained to `^[0-9a-f]{64}$`. A fresh v0.10.0 store
declares `PRAGMA user_version = 2`, chains every append, and holds
`event_hash NOT NULL` at the database layer; a pre-existing unchained store is
widened by the explicit `loop migrate` verb (§22), which never rewrites rows.

**Canonical form (normative).** `event_hash` is the lowercase-hex SHA-256 of
the UTF-8 encoding of

```python
json.dumps(preimage, sort_keys=True, separators=(",", ":"),
           ensure_ascii=False, allow_nan=False)
```

where `preimage` is exactly these **twelve** fields:

`schema`, `run_id`, `sequence`, `event_id`, `type`, `actor`, `ts`,
`causation_id`, `correlation_id`, `payload`, `artifact_hashes`,
`prev_event_hash`.

Insertion order is irrelevant (`sort_keys=True` fixes the serialized order).
`event_hash` is never part of its own preimage. An **absent optional field is
hashed as `null`, never omitted** — the preimage object always carries all
twelve keys. A genesis event (the run's `sequence` 0) hashes
`prev_event_hash: null`.

Two caveats for non-Python re-implementations. (1) Floats serialize through
Python's shortest-round-trip `repr`, which other languages' default float
formatting does not necessarily reproduce; keep payload numbers integral or
string-encoded if you need cross-language digests. `allow_nan=False` means
`NaN`/`Infinity` are a hard error, not a serialized token. (2)
`ensure_ascii=False` emits non-ASCII characters literally in UTF-8 and
`sort_keys` orders keys by code point, so **ASCII-only object keys are
recommended** for interop.

**Conformance vectors.** Three records and their digests, generated by
`loop/chain.py` and pinned against it by
`scripts/test_event_chain.py::test_documented_conformance_vectors` — docs and
code cannot drift. Each `Preimage` line is the exact canonical string that is
UTF-8 encoded and SHA-256'd.

**Third-party re-verification.**
`loop.chain.verify_chain(events, expected_head=...)` is the normative entry
point for re-verifying a chain outside this package's store code: it is pure,
I/O-free, imports no other `loop` module, and accepts any ordered sequence of
event mappings (a SQLite read, a JSONL export, a JSON API response). It
returns `{ok, issues, chained_events, unchained_prefix, head}`, and with
`expected_head` set it additionally fails when the stream's final chained head
is absent or differs. **Scope:** `verify_chain` verifies a *complete run
stream beginning at sequence 0*. It cannot validate a suffix or a slice — a
window that starts mid-run has no genesis to anchor `prev_event_hash: null`
against, and its first record's link is unverifiable by construction.

**Interop rule (normative).** Populating the chain fields is optional per run
but all-or-nothing after the first chained event: once an event carries
`event_hash`, every later event in that run must too and must match the
canonical preimage exactly, or the reference implementation hard-fails the
store.

**Resume rule (normative).** `reduce_events(events, initial=snapshot)` folds a
suffix onto a caller-supplied projection, and the chain is anchored by that
snapshot's `chain_head`. A snapshot that predates v0.10.0 has no `chain_head`
key at all, so a suffix whose first event is chained with a non-null
`prev_event_hash` has nothing to link against: that is refused as an
`EventReplayError` naming the stale snapshot, never as a `ChainBreakError` —
an honest resume is not a tamper report. Re-fold from sequence 0, or carry
`chain_head` in the snapshot. A suffix that begins at a chain genesis
(`prev_event_hash: null`), and a fully unchained suffix, resume unchanged.

**Compatibility rule.** A pre-0.10.0 writer must not append to a chained
store. A fresh v0.10.0 store refuses such an append at the database
(`event_hash NOT NULL`); a migrated store cannot, and an unchained row
appended after a chained prefix is reported as `event_chain_broken` and is
unrepairable, because UPDATE is trigger-blocked. Pin your loop-engineer (and
action) version per store.

**Bound artifacts (v0.11.0+).** `artifact_hashes` is field eleven of the
twelve-field preimage, so any `{path, sha256}` an appender places there is
already covered by `event_hash` and therefore by `--expect-chain-head`. Binding
evidence needs **no new event type and no second append**: since the
evidence-wiring release a verified dispatch binds three entries on the one
`iteration_appended` event it already writes — the verify bundle, its evidence@1
record, and the bundle's content-addressed object (§17). The digests are
computed **before** the append and the files are written **after** it. An event
that binds nothing — every event written before that release, and every append
by a foreign writer — is silent by construction, and stays silent: the
append-only triggers forbid the UPDATE a retroactive binding would need, exactly
as `loop migrate` refuses to backfill chain hashes (§22).

### Integrity boundary

The chain is **tamper-evident relative to an anchored head**. That is a
detection property, not a prevention one, and it is scoped to the anchor:
nothing here stops a writer from changing the log. Stating the boundary in
both directions is part of the contract — a reader must know exactly which
claims a clean chain supports.

**It detects:** splicing an event into the middle of a log; reordering events;
editing a committed row without recomputing every downstream digest; byte
corruption of any hashed field; and — given an externally remembered anchor —
*any* divergence of the log from the head that anchor names, including
truncation of the tail and wholesale replacement of the history. Note the
asymmetry: truncation is detected **only** with an anchor, because deleting
trailing events leaves a shorter but internally valid chain.

**It does not detect:**

- **A full in-workspace recompute.** A process with write access to the
  workspace can rewrite history, re-chain from genesis, and forge
  `.loop/state.json` and `terminal_state.json` to agree. With no anchor
  supplied, the event-store block of such a report is wholly clean —
  `state_json_agrees`, `deterministic`, and `legal_sequence` all `true`, a
  `FailedBlocked` run laundered into `Succeeded` — as pinned by
  `scripts/test_adversarial_chain.py::test_full_rewrite_with_recompute_passes_without_anchor_pinned`.
  (In the probe that produced that fixture the report was also globally `ok`
  with zero issues. What the committed pin actually asserts is narrower and
  event-store-scoped: that `event_chain_broken` is absent, that the three
  projection-disagreement codes `state_field_mismatch`,
  `desynced_terminal_window` and `terminal_state_mismatch` stay absent, and
  that the three event-store cleanliness flags `state_json_agrees`,
  `deterministic` and `legal_sequence` stay `true`. A future standalone
  event-store cross-check — a new issue code appended directly to `issues`, as
  `chain_columns_missing` is — would not move any of those, so it must be added
  to this pin's assertions when it is introduced. The evidence-wiring release
  introduced exactly two such codes, `evidence_chain_mismatch` and
  `missing_bound_evidence`; this pin's assertions were **not** widened to name
  them. The stronger statement lives in the binding suite instead:
  `scripts/test_adversarial_evidence_binding.py::test_a_full_rewrite_of_artifacts_and_store_is_not_caught_without_an_anchor_pinned`
  rewrites the artifacts, the object, the bound digests and the chain, and
  asserts the whole report is `ok` with **zero** issues.)
- **A chain-column downgrade.** Dropping `event_hash`/`prev_event_hash`, or
  rebuilding the store without them, silently downgrades a chained history to
  an unchained one. An unchained or legacy doctor report is *not* proof of
  provenance. The `chain_columns_missing` check catches only the lazy variant
  — columns dropped while `user_version` still declares generation 2; a
  downgrade that also resets `user_version` leaves nothing but the anchor.
- **Deleting the store outright**, when no SQLite sidecars remain and no
  `--expect-chain-head` is supplied: a bare `loop doctor` reads that as a
  valid never-ran contract (§22).
- **Well-formed lies.** Nothing in the chain judges whether a payload is
  *true*. A truthfully-recorded, correctly-hashed event asserting a test
  passed when it did not is chain-clean by construction; that is the job of
  evidence@1, the held-out gate, and the verifier — not of the digest.
- **Anything in a never-migrated prefix.** Rows written before migration have
  no hashes to break, so there is no retroactive coverage: doctor reports them
  as `unchained_prefix` and never elides them.

**The mid-run window.** An anchor certifies the log only up to the anchored
head. Everything appended after the last externally-read anchor — including a
rewrite of the suffix — is unverified until the next anchor is read and
remembered outside the workspace. The chain narrows the tampering window; it
does not close it.

Three closing notes. The append-only `BEFORE UPDATE`/`BEFORE DELETE` triggers
are an anti-footgun, not a security control: any writer holding the database
file can `DROP TRIGGER` first. The chain is one of several cross-checks a full
rewrite must satisfy *simultaneously* — `_state_divergence` (state.json
agreement), `_terminal_desync` (terminal-file agreement), and G1 completion
all still apply, which raises the cost of a convincing forgery without
bounding it. And `scripts/test_adversarial_chain.py` pins **both** sides of
this boundary: the attacks that are caught, and four `PINNED LIMITATION`
cases that are not — the full in-workspace rewrite, tail truncation without an
anchor, tampering inside a never-migrated prefix, and the chain-column
downgrade.

## 17. `loop-engineer/evidence@1` — hashed evidence + artifact provenance

`schemas/evidence.schema.json` defines a standalone, hashed record that names
an evidence artifact by workspace-relative URI, SHA-256 digest, media type,
producer, optional verifier, and optional policy result. `loop.evidence`
validates that portable record in either JSON Schema or complete structural
fallback mode; `verify_evidence()` additionally resolves the URI beneath a
workspace, rejects traversal and symlink escapes, and verifies the file hash.
`artifact_object_path()` supplies the v1 content-addressed object layout under
`.loop/artifacts/objects/` without writing it.

**Scope boundary:** `loop doctor` reads evidence@1 records from the declared
location `.loop/evidence/*.json`, validates them, **hash-verifies the artifact
each one references**, and compares the `policy_digest` of the **latest record
per task** against the live `TASKS.json` entry. Under the default
`all_required` completion policy `Succeeded` still requires non-empty evidence
*paths*; under the opt-in `all_required_verified_evidence` policy it requires
every entry to be a hash-verified evidence@1 record that — wherever an event
store exists to bind against — some event bound into the hash chain, and whose
recorded goalpost is the live one. `code_digest` is still never re-hashed
against the verifier file, and no check here proves who produced a record.

**Artifact provenance:** `kind` remains an open vocabulary (for example,
`verify-bundle`, `log`, `diff`, `screenshot`, or `report`), while `produced_by`
identifies the run, task, attempt, and executor that produced it. Verification
does not trust a path string: resolution and containment provide one mechanism
for rejecting both `..` traversal and symlink escapes before a 64 KiB-chunked
SHA-256 comparison is attempted.

### Verifier identity (v0.11.0+)

**The four fields.** `verified_by` gains four additive, nullable fields —
`command`, `code_digest`, `code_digest_basis`, and `policy_digest` — recording
what verified a task and how. `required` on `verified_by` stays `["by",
"at"]`; all four fields are optional and nullable, and both the JSON Schema
mode and the structural-fallback mode type-check them identically.

**The code-digest honesty rule.** `code_digest` hashes argv[0] of the declared
`verify` command only when it resolves to a readable regular file inside the
workspace; every other case is `null`, and `code_digest_basis` names exactly
why. The nine bases are the complete enumeration:

| basis | when | digest |
|---|---|---|
| `workspace_file` | argv[0] is a regular file under the workspace and was readable | hex sha256 |
| `path_lookup` | argv[0] has no path separator (`pytest`, `python3`, `true`) — the OS resolved it through `PATH`, so a same-named workspace file is *not* what ran | `null` |
| `outside_workspace` | argv[0] resolved to a real file outside the workspace (`/usr/bin/python3`, a symlink escaping the tree) | `null` |
| `not_a_file` | argv[0] does not resolve to an existing regular file (missing path, directory, dangling symlink) | `null` |
| `unresolvable` | resolving argv[0] raised `OSError` (or pathlib's `RuntimeError` on Python ≤3.12 for a symlink loop), permission-denied parent, or name too long — the honest "could not determine" | `null` |
| `unreadable` | the file exists inside the workspace but could not be read | `null` |
| `unparseable_command` | `shlex.split` raised | `null` |
| `empty_command` | `verify` is absent, blank, or splits to zero words | `null` |
| `injected_verifier` | the caller injected a verifier callable, so **no declared command ran** — recording one would be a fabrication | `null` |

`python3 -m pytest -q` has no hashable workspace script; `null` with basis
`path_lookup` is the truthful record, and a fabricated digest would be worse
than none. When a caller injects a verifier callable the declared command does
not run at all: `command` and `code_digest` are `null` with basis
`injected_verifier`. These nine values co-move across four surfaces:
`CODE_DIGEST_BASES` (`loop/verifier.py`), the `enum` in
`schemas/evidence.schema.json`, the structural-fallback check in
`loop/evidence.py`, and this table.

**The policy digest.** `policy_digest` is sha256 over
`loop.chain.canonical_json` of `{criterion_ref, depends_on, id, verify}` — the
TASKS.json entry's declared goalpost. Run state (`status`, `attempts`,
`evidence`) is excluded because it changes for non-policy reasons and would
make the digest noise; `id` binds *which* goalpost the digest names, and
`depends_on` binds its declared ordering, so both are included.

The digest binds the criterion **reference**, not the criterion **text** —
editing `SPEC.md`'s acceptance wording leaves it unchanged. The evidence-wiring
release did **not** change that: criterion text remains bound by nothing, pinned
by `test_criterion_text_is_still_unbound_pinned`. Binding evidence bytes does
not bind intent.

**Conformance vector.** Over the task entry

```python
{"id": "T-1", "title": "ignored", "status": "pending", "criterion_ref": "C-1",
 "verify": "./scripts/verify-fast.sh", "depends_on": [], "attempts": 0, "evidence": None}
```

`verification_policy` produces the canonical JSON

```
{"criterion_ref":"C-1","depends_on":[],"id":"T-1","verify":"./scripts/verify-fast.sh"}
```

and `verification_policy_digest` produces

```
cb28ced25ec75a20a153f821e7335464a1734eb781146a9d36a598e713caa9fe
```

`scripts/test_conformance.py` pins both literals against the live
implementation.

**The bundle/record pair.** A verified dispatch writes two files:
`.loop/artifacts/verify-iter<N>.json` (the bundle — carries `outcome`/`passed`
per the metrics green-marker convention, `verifier` including `source`, and
`partition`) and `.loop/evidence/evidence-iter<N>.json` (evidence@1 — commits
to the bundle bytes via `sha256`). An evidence record MUST NOT be named
`verify-*.json` — a record in the bundle namespace is read by metrics as a
bundle with no green marker, i.e. a phantom failing gate. `verifier.source` is
`declared_command` only when the task's declared `verify` command was
executed. A bundle whose source is `injected_callable` carries a
caller-supplied verdict and is not gate evidence. `scripts/metrics.py` enforces
that distinction: a bundle whose `verifier.source` is **explicitly**
`injected_callable` is excluded from the FCR input set before any metric is
derived, and the excluded filenames are listed under
`provenance.injected_verifier_bundles` so the exclusion is visible rather than a
silent FCR shift. A bundle carrying no `verifier` block at all has an *unknown*
source and still counts — grandfathering by absence, not by guess. `source` is a
string the writer declares, not a fact metrics can check, so hand-writing
`declared_command` restores gate-evidence status; that limitation is pinned by
`test_metrics_still_counts_a_hand_written_declared_command_bundle_pinned`.
Two input-set changes land together in this release and are stated rather than
absorbed: before it the runner wrote no bundles at all, and injected-callable
bundles counted — so a runner-driven contract's FCR input set moves on upgrade.
`loop simulate` predicts decisions, not writes: it reports
`legacy_sync_would_write` because that write is conditional, but it does not
enumerate the bundle, record and content-addressed object a dispatch always
writes, and it does not enumerate the object store. A boolean that is `True` on
every dispatch carries no information, so `_empty_prediction` gains no field
here (§20).

**The partition.** `visible` defaults to the task's `criterion_ref`;
`holdout` is empty unless the task declares `holdout_criteria`; both fields
are optional `array of string` on tasks@1; `holdout_executed` is always
`false` because the runner executes exactly the declared `verify` command.
Running a holdout set remains `scripts/holdout_gate.py`'s job and its verdict
keeps its own canonical shape. A misspelled field name validates (tasks@1 is
`additionalProperties: true`) and yields `declared: false` — an undeclared
partition and a mistyped one are indistinguishable.

**The independence rule.** A record whose `produced_by.executor` equals its
`verified_by.by` (compared strip+casefold) declares that the producer
verified its own work. `loop doctor` reports `self_verified_evidence` and
fails. On the `loop run` path both identities are operator-supplied
(`--executor`, `--verifier-identity`); their defaults (`unattributed`,
`loop.run`) never collide, so a default run cannot manufacture the finding.

### Bound evidence (v0.11.0+)

**The bound set, in the order the writer emits it.** A verified dispatch binds
exactly three `{path, sha256}` entries into the `artifact_hashes` of the one
`iteration_appended` event it already writes (§16), in this order:

1. `.loop/artifacts/verify-iter<N>.json` — the verify bundle, at the bundle's
   own sha256;
2. `.loop/evidence/evidence-iter<N>.json` — the evidence@1 record, at the
   record file's sha256;
3. `.loop/artifacts/objects/<aa>/<sha256>` — the content-addressed **object**, a
   byte-identical copy of the bundle, at the bundle's sha256 again.

**The object's location is derived, never declared.** It is
`artifact_object_path(workspace, record["sha256"])` —
`.loop/artifacts/objects/<first two hex chars>/<sha256>` — a pure function of a
digest evidence@1 already carries, so **evidence@1 gains no field** and a
third-party reader locates the object from `record["sha256"]` alone. The object
is the recovery source when the friendly-named bundle is swapped: the swap fails
doctor as `evidence_chain_mismatch` *and* the original bytes are still on disk.
Deleting the object first does not clear the path — the object is itself a bound
artifact, so its removal is reported as `missing_bound_evidence`.

**Objects are created once and never overwritten.** The write uses the same
hard-link create-once primitive as the immutable terminal record. An existing
object with identical bytes is idempotent success (a re-run of the same
dispatch); an existing object with **different** bytes for the same digest is a
typed `EmitError` naming the digest, because a corrupted or colliding object
store must never be silently accepted.

**Ordering: build (no I/O) → append (binds) → write (object, staged bundle,
record, replace).** The builder is pure — it renders the exact bytes and their
digests and touches nothing — so the event commits to digests that describe what
is about to land. Two consequences, both deliberate: a **build failure commits
nothing** (a non-canonicalizable task or an invalid record is refused before any
file exists), and a **crash after the durable append** leaves an event naming
artifacts that are absent — reported as `missing_bound_evidence` rather than
passing as a silent gap. The crash window still exists; what changed is that it
is no longer invisible.

### The verified-evidence completion mode (v0.11.0+)

`completion_policy.mode` accepts a second value,
`all_required_verified_evidence`, alongside the default `all_required`. The
criteria half is unchanged — every declared criterion must still be `True`; the
mode raises the **evidence** bar only. It is **opt-in and never retroactive**:
`normalize_completion_policy(None)` still returns `{"mode": "all_required"}`, so
every record written before this release — including both shipped examples,
which declare no policy at all — keeps the old bar forever
(`test_the_verified_evidence_mode_is_opt_in_and_not_retroactive_pinned`).

**Four enforcement layers, each as strong as it can honestly be.**

| Layer | Reaches | Enforces |
|---|---|---|
| `emit.terminate` (write time) | workspace + event store | the full bar; failure is a typed `EmitError` |
| `loop doctor` / `loop.contract` (read time) | workspace + event store | the same bar, reported as `unverified_evidence_terminal` |
| `loop.reducer` (pure fold) | nothing — no I/O | shape only: every entry is a workspace-relative `.loop/evidence/*.json` path |
| `loop.integrations.to_terminal_state` (pure projection) | nothing — no workspace | the same shape half, returning `FailedUnverifiable` rather than raising |

The two workspace-bearing layers share **one predicate**
(`loop.contract._strict_evidence_failure`); `emit.terminate` imports it rather
than restating it, because two hand-written copies of a four-part check drift
and a drift here is a silent false completion. That predicate is a strict
**superset** of the pure half: it applies the reducer's own
`evidence_entry_is_record_shaped` to the cited entry first, so the writer can
never accept a terminal that its own replay would refuse. The two pure layers
check shape and nothing else because they hold no filesystem — making them
*appear* to enforce binding would be the pretending this contract refuses.

**What the mode proves, exactly.** For every cited entry: (1) the entry resolves
to a readable evidence@1 record that validates, and the artifact its `uri` names
resolves inside the workspace and hashes to the digest the record declares;
(2) that artifact is a **verify bundle whose verdict is a pass**; (3) **when an
event store exists**, those record bytes are the bytes some event bound into the
chain, at that digest, and at exactly **one** digest; and (4) when the record
names a task still in `TASKS.json`, its recorded `policy_digest` equals the live
goalpost. A goalpost that cannot even be **computed** is a failure, not a skip —
unestablished is not agreement. An event store that cannot be **read** is likewise
a refusal, never a pass. The message names which of the four sub-checks failed.

**Check (2), the verdict, in full.** Authenticity is not success. A dispatch whose
verifier FAILS still writes and binds a perfectly genuine record — of a failure —
so the bar asks what the artifact SAYS as well as whether it is real. Green is the
repo's one green-marker rule, `loop.evidence.verify_bundle_is_green`: `outcome ==
"PASS"` **or** `passed is true`. A bundle carrying only a numeric `score` reads
**red**, here and in `scripts/metrics.py`, which imports the same predicate — a
bundle that reads red to the FCR gate can never read green to the completion gate.
`kind` is an open vocabulary, and a record that is **not** a `verify-bundle` (a
log, a diff, a screenshot) carries no verdict this layer can read: it is refused,
because an artifact with no verdict cannot show that anything passed. An
unreadable or unparseable verdict is a refusal, never a skip.

**Check (3), and why ambiguity is refused.** The write-time view
(`loop.runtime.bound_artifact_digests`) reports every **distinct** digest a path
was bound at, not the last one. Collapsing repeat bindings would be a laundering
channel rather than a summary: an append-only forge that re-binds a tampered path
at its new digest would look bound to the writer while the per-event walk still
reported `evidence_chain_mismatch` on the same tree. A path bound at two or more
different digests is therefore refused outright.

The scope of that refusal is the **cited** evidence, and no wider. The write-time
bar examines each entry a `Succeeded` terminal cites and the artifact that entry's
`uri` names; it does not walk the other paths those events happened to bind. So a
tree can carry an ambiguously-bound artifact that no terminal cites, and the
writer will not see it while `loop doctor`'s per-event walk still reports
`evidence_chain_mismatch`. The two layers agree about every path a terminal
rests on, which is the claim; they are not two spellings of the same sweep.

**What it does not prove, stated without hedging.** It does not prove that a
human, a runner, or anything at all *produced* the record: a hand-written record
whose pointer resolves and whose digests are self-consistent satisfies the mode
in a **store-less** contract, because there is nothing there to bind against
(`test_the_strict_mode_accepts_a_hand_written_record_in_a_store_less_contract_pinned`).
It does not prove the chain itself was not rewritten: a worker who can rewrite
`.loop/` can rewrite the store, so **without `--expect-chain-head` a full rewrite
of artifacts *and* chain satisfies the strict mode**
(`test_a_full_rewrite_satisfies_the_strict_mode_without_an_anchor_pinned`). The
mode's strength is therefore **store-dependent and anchor-dependent**.

**Deleting the store is not louder — it is quieter.** Measured, not assumed: a
sidecar-free read (v0.10.0) leaves no `-wal`/`-shm` behind, and doctor's
`missing_event_store` tripwire is gated on exactly that residue, so removing
`.loop/events.db` after an ordinary run leaves plain `loop doctor` at `ok: true`
with **zero issues**, and `emit.terminate` then accepts a hand-written record
under the strict mode. `missing_event_store` catches only the sloppier deletion
that leaves a sidecar. The control that does hold is the external anchor:
`loop doctor --expect-chain-head <head>` reports `chain_anchor_mismatch` against
the deleted store and stays quiet against an intact one. Without an external
anchor, deleting the store silently disables this mode's chain-boundness check.

**A deliberate asymmetry with doctor's general goalpost check.** Doctor compares
the **latest record per task** (see the tier list below); the terminal check
compares **every cited record**. "Latest" orders numbered
`evidence-iter<N>.json` records by iteration and ranks every **unnumbered** record
below all of them, ties broken by filename — unnumbered records are ranked in, not
dropped, so a task whose only record carries no iteration id is still compared. Citing a record in a `Succeeded` terminal is a
present-tense claim that *this* record backs completion now, so a stale goalpost
in a cited record is a false completion, not an artifact of history.

**`loop run`'s auto-terminal adopts the mode only when it can satisfy it**, and
never on file existence: it evaluates the same shared predicate against the very
records it would cite, **before** appending the terminal event. When it cannot,
it writes `{"mode": "all_required"}` with `evidence: ["RUNLOG.md"]` and says why
in `reason` — either `tasks with no evidence record: …` or `evidence records do
not meet the verified-evidence bar: <record> <sub-check>`. Downgrading silently
would be a self-serving choice; both branches are pinned.

### Upgrade notes — four behavioural changes, stated without hedging

These are not opt-in, and two of them can turn a contract that was clean on the
previous release red on this one. They are recorded here rather than left to be
discovered.

**1. `policy_digest_mismatch` is NOT opt-in, and its remedy is currently
unsatisfying.** The verified-evidence *completion mode* is opt-in; this doctor
check is not. A contract that was doctor-clean at v0.10.0 goes **red** on upgrade
as soon as anyone makes an ordinary goalpost edit — changing a task's `verify`,
`criterion_ref`, `depends_on` or `id` after a verification was recorded. The
documented remedy is "re-verify to record the current goalpost", and in a
loop whose done-ness comes from the event log the runner will not re-verify a task
it already considers done, so re-verification does not generally help. Measured,
the reliable route back to green is to **rename the task** — which is precisely the
evasion the tier list below admits this check cannot catch (a record naming a task
absent from `TASKS.json` is never compared). So the check is honest about a moved
goalpost and weak against a determined one, and the operator's real options today
are: edit goalposts *before* the verification that records them, re-run the
dispatch so a fresh record is written, or accept the finding as the true statement
that the declared goalpost moved after the work was verified. A first-class
"re-baseline this task's goalpost" affordance does not exist yet.

**2. The `completion_policy` enum widening is forward-INCOMPATIBLE as a hard
error.** `all_required_verified_evidence` is a new enum member, so an **older**
kernel reading a terminal that declares it reports `invalid_completion_policy`
and `schema_violation` — it does not degrade to the old bar, it fails. This
matters concretely for a README-pinned action and for `uvx loop-engineer@0.10.0`:
a gate pinned to a release older than 0.11.0 will reject a contract written by a
newer one. Pin the gate and the writer to the same
release, or keep writing `all_required` until the gate is upgraded.

**3. `os.link` now runs once PER DISPATCH, not once per run.** The
content-addressed object is placed with the same create-once hard link as the
immutable terminal record, and every dispatch places one. On a filesystem without
hard-link support (some network and container-overlay mounts, and any FAT-family
volume) the link fails, so **every dispatch becomes a committed-then-failed
iteration**: the durable event is already appended when the object write raises.
Previously the same limitation existed but was hit once, at terminal write. There
is no fallback copy path by design — a non-atomic create would reopen the
overwrite race the hard link closes — so this is a known limitation of running a
loop on such a filesystem, not a configuration option.

**4. A bound artifact above the read cap fails doctor, and there is no knob.** The
binding walk refuses to hash a bound path larger than `MAX_BOUND_ARTIFACT_BYTES`
(64 MiB) and reports `missing_bound_evidence`, because a gate must not perform an
unbounded read on a path an event names. A loop that legitimately binds an
artifact above that size — a large log, a coverage dump — therefore goes red with
no in-product remedy and no configuration option, the same un-satisfiable shape as
note 1. Bind a digest of the large artifact rather than the artifact itself, or
keep it out of `artifact_hashes`.

### The integrity boundary, in four honest tiers

Not a single "surfaces / does not surface" pair:

- **Fails `loop doctor`:** a record declaring self-verification
  (`self_verified_evidence`); a runner-written bundle whose record is absent
  (`missing_evidence_record`); a malformed or unparseable record
  (`invalid_evidence` — an errored check fails, it never skips). Added by the
  evidence-wiring release: a discovered record whose referenced artifact does
  not match its `sha256` (`hash_mismatch`) or does not resolve at all
  (`missing_evidence_path`, surfaced verbatim out of `verify_evidence`); the
  **latest** record for a task whose recorded goalpost disagrees with — or
  cannot be compared against — the live `TASKS.json` entry
  (`policy_digest_mismatch`); a chain-bound artifact whose bytes changed
  (`evidence_chain_mismatch`) or vanished (`missing_bound_evidence`); and a
  `Succeeded` terminal under `all_required_verified_evidence` whose cited
  evidence fails the bar (`unverified_evidence_terminal`).
- **Recorded for later comparison, not checked by any shipped surface:**
  `code_digest`, and now only `code_digest`. Nothing re-hashes the verifier
  file, and nothing will without a declared baseline: a verify script
  legitimately changes between runs, so an unbaselined comparison would fire on
  every honest edit. A swapped verify script therefore remains *legible in a
  diff of two records* and nothing more
  (`test_doctor_does_not_re_hash_the_verifier_file_pinned`). **`policy_digest`
  has left this tier** — the evidence-wiring release compares it against the
  live goalpost.
- **Detectable only by explicitly calling `verify_evidence()`:** **this tier is
  now empty.** The evidence-wiring release composes that call inside
  `loop doctor` for every discovered record, so a swapped bundle — the one
  member this tier ever had — now fails doctor as `hash_mismatch` in the first
  tier above.
- **Not surfaced at all:** a worker that writes a false `verified_by.by`; a
  worker that omits its executor identity; a hand-written record whose pointer
  resolves and whose digests are self-consistent (verification proves the
  *pointer*, never the *provenance* —
  `test_a_hand_written_record_pointing_at_a_real_file_still_passes_pinned`); the
  *text* of a criterion, which `policy_digest` never covered and still does not.
  Plus the residuals this release's own binding leaves, each pinned by name:
  - a record written through the **writer API** (`emit.write_verify_evidence`)
    appends no event, so nothing binds it and a later rewrite is invisible
    (`test_a_record_written_outside_a_dispatch_is_never_chain_bound_pinned`);
  - a **legacy** event carries `artifact_hashes: []` and can never be bound
    retroactively — the append-only triggers forbid the UPDATE a backfill would
    need — so a pre-release iteration whose evidence was deleted stays
    undetectable at this layer forever
    (`test_a_legacy_iteration_event_can_never_be_bound_retroactively_pinned`);
  - an **older** record for a task whose goalpost has since moved is not
    compared, because comparing every record would make each honest
    re-verification a permanent failure
    (`test_an_older_record_for_a_moved_goalpost_is_not_compared_pinned`);
  - a hand-written record **satisfies `all_required_verified_evidence` in a
    contract that has no event store**, because there is nothing to bind
    against — and deleting a store from a run that had one is *quieter*, not
    louder: sidecar-free reads leave no residue for the `missing_event_store`
    tripwire, so plain doctor reports `ok` with zero issues. The external
    anchor is the compensating control
    (`test_the_strict_mode_accepts_a_hand_written_record_in_a_store_less_contract_pinned`);
  - deleting the artifacts, the records, the store **and** its sidecars leaves a
    contract that never ran, and doctor is clean and correct to be — detection
    needs something outside the tree
    (`test_deleting_every_artifact_and_the_store_leaves_a_clean_doctor_pinned`,
    whose own positive control is the anchor);
  - and — the headline — **a worker who can rewrite `.loop/` can rewrite the
    store, so without `--expect-chain-head` a full rewrite of artifacts *and*
    chain verifies clean, including under the strict completion mode**
    (`test_a_full_rewrite_of_artifacts_and_store_is_not_caught_without_an_anchor_pinned`,
    `test_a_full_rewrite_satisfies_the_strict_mode_without_an_anchor_pinned`).

This does not prove independence. It surfaces **declared** self-verification,
and it records — honestly, with nulls where the process could not know — what
verified the work. This does not make evidence tamper-proof. It binds evidence
bytes into a chain someone outside the worker's trust domain can anchor, and it
fails closed when what is on disk is not what was verified.

---

## 18. `terminal_superseded` — administrative terminal corrections

`terminal_superseded` is an append-only administrative event that corrects the
currently effective terminal record while preserving the original decision and
every later correction in the reducer projection's oldest-first
`superseded_history`. Each correction carries the corrected terminal fields,
non-empty `justification`, and `{by, at}` `authority`, and its `causation_id`
must identify the terminal event it corrects; chained corrections therefore
remain auditable without replacing any record.

**Scope boundary:** this event type has no corresponding `loop.emit` writer
operation — deliberately: unlike the first four types, `terminal_superseded` is
administrative and event-log-only (§16's type list records which four types map
to writer operations and which five do not). It is not file-based `terminal@1`
replacement or an `emit`/`doctor` workflow.

**Domain enforcement:** the EventStore validates envelope and payload shape
only; the reducer alone admits this type after a terminal, verifies its
causation anchor, and reuses G1 completion checks when a correction sets
`state` to `Succeeded`. All other event types remain forbidden after a terminal.

---

## 19. Run-control events

`approval_requested`, `approval_resolved`, `run_paused`, and `run_resumed` are
event@1 run-control primitives. `approval_requested` records a non-empty
request, moves the reducer projection to `approval-wait`, and records a pending
approval anchor. `approval_resolved` cites that anchor through `causation_id`;
an approved resolution supplies a legal non-terminal FSM resume target, while a
denied resolution leaves the projected state at `approval-wait` and clears the
pending request.

`run_paused` and `run_resumed` are projection overlays: they set and clear the
projection's `paused` flag and pause reason without changing the FSM state, so
resume preserves the exact prior state. These types, like every non-
`terminal_superseded` event, are forbidden after a terminal record.

**Interop note:** the pre-existing lightweight
`iteration_appended(outcome="approval_requested", state="approval-wait")`
path remains valid. It has no structured request or pending-approval anchor,
so it cannot be consumed by `approval_resolved`; CLI emission policy remains
out of scope for event@1.

---

## 20. `loop simulate` — read-only dispatch prediction

`loop simulate [--mode basic|strict|release] <workspace>` projects the event
store and reports what one `loop run` step would do, without dispatching a
task, invoking its verifier, repairing legacy files, or writing any workspace
artifact. It uses the event store's immutable-first read path; when a crash
left a WAL sidecar, `events.db-shm` is the sole permitted coordination-file
difference and durable event content remains unchanged.

The report includes normal projection health (`divergence`, `terminal_desync`,
and `ok`), plus a `would` object. Its action vocabulary is deliberately
predictive: `would_dispatch`, `would_write_terminal`, `would_block`,
`would_refuse`, or `already_terminal`. `would_dispatch` exposes the declared
verify command and parsed argv, but never executes it. `would_refuse` carries
the matching runner refusal text; `would_block` has no invented refusal text.
For terminal completion prediction, `predicted_terminal` is the payload a real
dispatch would append.

`would.legacy_sync_would_write` identifies whether a real dispatch would enter
one of its legacy reconciliation writes. Its calculation follows the runner's
terminal-first branch structure: terminal reconciliation is assessed only for
terminal projections, iteration lag only for `execute-task`, and all other
non-terminal states report false. A missing or unreadable required state file
is reported as null rather than repaired.

---

## 21. `loop architect` — typed fail-loud deferral

`loop architect` is a permanent typed refusal, not a scaffold. Architecture
classification and ADR authorship — choosing the loop's shape, its
Claude-Code realization, its loop patterns, its risk profile, its
terminal-state plan — is agentic judgment the loop-architect skill performs,
and this deterministic CLI does not call an LLM to reproduce it. A
placeholder ADR file with `REPLACE` fields for the decision itself
(architecture, realization, risk profile) would carry no real information
while looking like a completed judgment artifact to whatever consumes it
next — that is a silent stub in disguise, not a scaffold, so this verb does
not write one.

Every invocation of `loop architect`, with any argv shape (a target, no
target, a nonexistent target, any `--mode` value, any other flag), exits `2`
before parsing a target or a validation mode and prints a single typed message
to stderr pointing at the loop-architect skill and at `loop scaffold` as the
deterministic next step once a real architecture decision record exists. It
performs zero filesystem or event-store I/O: no `sqlite3.connect`, no
`subprocess.run`, no read of `.loop/state.json` or `TASKS.json`. There is no
`0` or `1` exit path — every path is the same typed `2` refusal.

## 22. `loop doctor` — event-store consistency gate

When `.loop/events.db` exists, `loop doctor` composes the exact read-only
`status`/`replay` verbs (§16, §20) — never duplicating their fold/divergence
logic — and folds their findings into its own `issues`/`ok`. An absent store
**with no SQLite sidecar residue and no `--expect-chain-head`** is conformant:
doctor reports `"event_store": {"present": false}` and every other key is
byte-identical to a store-less report; sidecar residue
(`missing_event_store`) or a supplied anchor (`chain_anchor_mismatch`) fails
doctor. When an absent store *does* raise one of those, the block gains the
residue flag — `{"present": false, "sidecar_residue": true}` for a deleted
store whose `-wal`/`-shm` files remain, and `sidecar_residue: false` when the
only finding is the anchor. A present, readable store adds
`"event_store": {"present": true, "readable": true, "run_id", "event_count",
"state_json_agrees", "deterministic", "legal_sequence", "chain"}`; any of
`state_field_mismatch`, `desynced_terminal_window`, `terminal_state_mismatch`,
`illegal_event_sequence`, `event_chain_broken`, `chain_columns_missing`,
`evidence_chain_mismatch`, `missing_bound_evidence`, `bound_evidence_escape`, or
`chain_anchor_mismatch` fails doctor (`ok: false`). The findings that come from
the composed verbs keep the identical issue code those verbs already use;
`chain_columns_missing`, `evidence_chain_mismatch`, `missing_bound_evidence` and
`bound_evidence_escape` are doctor's own store-gated checks, appended to the same list. A store that cannot be read at
all — `corrupt_store`, `empty_store`, `invalid_event`, or `ambiguous_run_id` —
also fails doctor rather than being silently skipped; `"event_store"` reports
`{"present": true, "readable": false, "error_code": <code>}` in that case.
Note the ordering consequence: event@1 validation runs before the fold, so a
tamper that *also* breaks the envelope or payload shape (a payload edit that
drops a required field, say) surfaces as `invalid_event` on an unreadable
store, never as `event_chain_broken`.

**The `chain` block.** A present, readable store nests
`"chain": {"head": {"sequence", "event_hash"} | null, "unchained_prefix": <int>}`
under `event_store`. `head` is `null` for a store with no chained events at
all (a legacy or fully downgraded store) **and also for a store whose chain is
broken**, because the fold stops at the break and never establishes a head. The
block alone therefore does not distinguish "never chained" from "chain broken";
the `event_chain_broken` issue is what separates them, and a `null` head with
no such issue is the honest never-chained case. `unchained_prefix` counts the
leading events that carry no `event_hash`; it is **never elided** — a migrated
store legitimately reports a non-zero prefix, and silently hiding it would let
a legacy tail read as chained provenance. A prefix is not an issue by itself;
it is the honest statement of how much of the log the chain does not cover.

**New issue codes.**

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `event_chain_broken` | A link check failed: `prev_event_hash` mismatch, recomputed `event_hash` mismatch, an unhashable record, or an unchained row appended after a chained prefix. Unrepairable — UPDATE is trigger-blocked. |
| `chain_anchor_mismatch` | `--expect-chain-head` was supplied and the store's actual head is absent, unreadable, unchained, or a different digest. |
| `chain_columns_missing` | The store declares `user_version >= 2` but the chain columns are gone — the lazy downgrade. A downgrade that also resets `user_version` is invisible here; the anchor is the real control. |
| `missing_event_store` | `events.db` is absent but `-wal`/`-shm` sidecars remain — the store was deleted. Distinct from the pre-existing `missing_store`, which `status`/`replay`/`run`/`migrate` raise when a verb that *requires* a store is pointed at a workspace that has none; `missing_event_store` is a doctor finding about a store that evidently once existed. |
| `self_verified_evidence` | A discovered evidence@1 record declares `produced_by.executor == verified_by.by` (strip+casefold) — the producer verified its own work. Enforces the independence rule of `reference/safety-and-approvals.md` §5, which was prose-only before v0.11.0. |
| `missing_evidence_record` | A runner-written verify bundle `.loop/artifacts/verify-iter<N>.json` exists with no matching `.loop/evidence/evidence-iter<N>.json`. Residue of a removed provenance record, in the same family as `missing_event_store`. Fires only when a bundle is present, so an absent-everything contract stays byte-identical. |
| `evidence_chain_mismatch` | An artifact whose digest an event bound into the hash chain no longer matches its bytes on disk. The message names the digest the chain committed and the digest found; the original bytes may still remain in the content-addressed object store at `.loop/artifacts/objects/<aa>/<sha256>`. |
| `missing_bound_evidence` | An event bound an artifact path into the chain and that path is now absent or unreadable — a deleted bundle/record pair, a deleted object, the sanctioned crash window between the durable append and the evidence write, or a path that resolves to something the gate refuses to read (a non-regular file such as a device or FIFO, or a file above the 64 MiB bound-artifact read cap). Fires only for events that bound something: a legacy event binds nothing and is silent by construction. |
| `bound_evidence_escape` | An event bound a path that is not inside the workspace — absolute, drive-lettered, backslashed, `..`-traversing, or resolving outside through a symlinked component. `event@1` constrains `path` only to a non-empty string and the chain covers a binding rather than vouching for it, so the binding walk containment-checks every declared path **before** opening anything: an escaping path is reported, never read. |
| `policy_digest_mismatch` | The **latest** evidence record for a task records a `policy_digest` that is not the live `TASKS.json` goalpost — the declared `verify`/`criterion_ref`/`depends_on`/`id` changed after the verification. Also fires when the live entry cannot be canonicalized at all, because a comparison that cannot run has not passed. Re-verify to record the current goalpost. |
| `unverified_evidence_terminal` | A `Succeeded` terminal declaring `completion_policy.mode: all_required_verified_evidence` has an evidence entry that fails one of the mode's four checks: it is not a hash-verified evidence@1 record; or it does not point at a `verify-bundle` whose verdict is a pass; or (when an event store exists) no event bound those bytes into the chain, or events bound that path at two or more different digests; or the record's `policy_digest` is not the live `TASKS.json` goalpost for the task it names. The message names which. An unreadable store is also a failure. In a contract with **no** event store the chain check is skipped — the mode's strength is store-dependent by construction (§17). |

**Do not confuse `missing_evidence_record` with `missing_evidence_path`.** They
are opposite directions of the same pair. `missing_evidence_record` walks
*bundles* looking for the record that should describe them.
`missing_evidence_path` comes straight out of `verify_evidence()` and means a
*record's* `uri` does not resolve. Both can be true at once and neither implies
the other.

**Evidence discovery (v0.11.0+).** `loop doctor` scans `.loop/evidence/*.json`
when the directory exists; an absent directory with no runner bundle is a
no-op that leaves every doctor key byte-identical (no new top-level key was
added). A malformed or unparseable record **fails** doctor rather than being
skipped, and `loop-engineer/evidence@1` joins `schemas_checked` when at least
one record was read. Since the evidence-wiring release each structurally-valid
record is additionally passed to `verify_evidence()` — surfacing
`hash_mismatch`, `missing_evidence_path`, `workspace_escape`, `not_a_file` and
`invalid_uri` **verbatim**, per the rule that doctor composes a verb and reuses
its issue codes rather than inventing parallel ones — and the latest record per
task is compared against the live goalpost (`policy_digest_mismatch`). The
`verify_evidence()` call is guarded on the record having no structural issues,
so a malformed record is reported once, not twice. The chain-binding walk is a
separate, store-gated check that lives beside `chain_columns_missing` in the
event-store block above; it costs one extra read-only fold of the store, because
it needs envelope-level `artifact_hashes` that no report returns and widening a
report's dict would leak into the `loop status` / `loop replay` CLI JSON.

**`loop migrate`.** `loop migrate <workspace>` is the only store-upgrade path:
explicit, idempotent, and non-rewriting. It widens `events` with the two
nullable chain columns and stamps `user_version = 2`; it never backfills
hashes onto existing rows, because the append-only triggers forbid UPDATE and
a backfilled digest would be an assertion about history the store cannot
support. Pre-migration rows therefore remain an unchained prefix forever, and
the first post-migration append is a chain genesis
(`chained_from_sequence` in the migrate report names it). Because migrated
columns stay nullable, a migrated store — unlike a fresh one — cannot refuse a
pre-0.10.0 writer at the database layer (see §16's compatibility rule).

**Concurrency assumption.** The read verbs assume no concurrent writer — the
sidecar-free guarantee holds only for a store whose last writer closed
cleanly. `loop doctor`/`status`/`replay`/`simulate` open the store read-only
and immutable when no WAL sidecar exists, so a clean store is read without
leaving a byte behind; against a store with a live or crashed writer, a
`-wal`/`-shm` sidecar is the sole permitted coordination-file difference (§20)
and durable event content still never changes.

### Anchor trust assumptions

`--expect-chain-head` (valid on `doctor`, and identically on its `validate`
and `verify` aliases) fails hard when the store is missing, unreadable, has no
chained head, or has a head that differs from the supplied digest. It is the
only cross-run tamper control in the toolchain — and it is only as trustworthy
as the place the anchor is read from. The anchor is outside the worker's trust
domain when **all three** hold:

1. **The gate is not installed from the worker's own checkout.** The
   `loop-engineer` GitHub Action is pinned to a released tag or SHA of a repo
   the worker cannot write, **and** its `version` input is non-empty — with an
   empty `version` the `Install loop-engineer` step takes its fallback branch
   and installs the kernel from `github.action_path`, i.e. the checkout under
   test, so the code doing the verifying is code the worker may have edited.
2. **The invoking workflow is protected from worker edits** — a required
   workflow, CODEOWNERS on `.github/`, or a branch ruleset. For a same-repo
   pull request the workflow that runs is *the PR head's*, so an unprotected
   workflow file is an unprotected anchor.
3. **The expected head is remembered outside the workspace** — a repository
   variable, a protected environment, or an operator's own record. A digest
   read out of the tree it is meant to certify certifies nothing.

State it plainly: **with the default empty `expect-chain-head`, this action
performs no cross-run tamper detection; it records the head for a comparison
someone else must make.** That recording is the action's `chain-head` output
and a line in its step summary — the place an operator reads the observed head
in order to re-anchor the next run. When an anchor *is* supplied and does not
match, the mismatch itself surfaces in doctor's issue list as
`chain_anchor_mismatch`.

Always pass an anchor in CI. A bare `loop doctor` treats a fully deleted
store — no database, no sidecars — as a valid never-ran contract, so
"delete the evidence" is a passing run without one.


## 23. `loop-engineer/verdict@1` — the CI-attested verdict predicate

`loop verdict <workspace>` projects a **finished** run into one canonical JSON
document: the doctor verdict, the chain head, the terminal outcome, and the
chain-bound evidence digests that pass §17's strict verified-evidence bar. The
kernel emits the **predicate body only**. It never signs, never verifies a
signature, never constructs an in-toto Statement (`_type`, `subject`,
`predicateType`, and `predicate` keys are forbidden in its output), and never
reads an environment variable — every one of those boundaries is a mechanical
test, not an intention. The signer lane (`action.yml`'s opt-in `attest` input
→ `actions/attest`) owns the envelope, the subject, and all cryptography:
**the kernel disposes on contents; the CI lane notarizes context; neither is
the other.**

Serialization is §16's canonical JSON — sorted keys, compact separators,
`ensure_ascii: false`, `allow_nan: false` — so the same run always projects
the same bytes, and a value canonical JSON cannot carry (a NaN smuggled into a
terminal record) is a typed refusal at the CLI, never a crash.

**Conformance vector (machine-pinned).** `null` is legal for `chain.head`,
`chain.sequence`, `tool.version`, and `terminal.completion_policy`; every
other key is always present. The field set is an allowlist enforced by test —
everything in this document is public, append-only, and permanent, so adding a
field is a one-way door.

```json
{
  "schema": "loop-engineer/verdict@1",
  "run_id": "coverage-repair",
  "tool": { "name": "loop-engineer", "version": "0.11.0" },
  "doctor": {
    "ok": true,
    "validation_mode": "jsonschema",
    "issue_codes": [],
    "schemas_checked": ["loop-engineer/manifest@1", "loop-engineer/state@1"]
  },
  "chain": {
    "head": "9f2c…64hex",
    "sequence": 41,
    "unchained_prefix": 0
  },
  "terminal": {
    "state": "Succeeded",
    "completion_policy": "all_required_verified_evidence",
    "false_completion": false
  },
  "evidence": [
    {
      "digest": "a1b2…64hex",
      "code_digest": "c3d4…64hex",
      "policy_digest": "e5f6…64hex"
    }
  ]
}
```

Field semantics:

- `run_id` — the **one operator-controlled string** in the document,
  allowlisted deliberately so a verdict can be correlated to a run. It lands
  in a permanent public log: run ids must not embed sensitive text. Every
  other string is a digest, an enum, a snake_case issue code, or a schema id —
  a whitespace-bearing value anywhere else is a conformance failure.
- `doctor.issue_codes` — **codes only, sorted, de-duplicated.** Never
  `message`, never `path`. Free-text detail strings and workspace paths do
  not leave the machine.
- `doctor.validation_mode` — which strength the contract was validated at
  (`jsonschema` or `structural-fallback`); without it, `ok: true` from a
  fallback environment would read as the stronger claim.
- `chain.head` / `chain.sequence` — the store's chained head (§22's `chain`
  block). `null` for a store-less workspace **and** for a store whose chain
  never established a head; `unchained_prefix` carries §16's honest count of
  events the chain does not cover.
- `terminal.completion_policy` — the policy `mode` string, or `null` for a
  legacy record that never declared one. Without it a reader cannot tell what
  `Succeeded` meant (`all_required` vs `all_required_verified_evidence`).
- `evidence[]` — one entry per **chain-bound** terminal-evidence record that
  passes §17's strict bar, digests only. `digest` is the SHA-256 of the
  evidence@1 **record file bytes** — the exact digest the event chain
  committed — never the record's own `sha256` field, which hashes the cited
  artifact instead. `code_digest`/`policy_digest` lift from the record's
  `verified_by`. Entries are de-duplicated and sorted by
  `(digest, code_digest, policy_digest)` with `null` ordered as the empty
  string. No URIs: a URI is a workspace path, and this document is public.

**Refusals and degradations.** A workspace with no terminal record refuses,
typed — a verdict projects a finished run. A terminal record whose
`false_completion` is absent or non-boolean refuses: projecting `false` for an
unknown safety flag would trade an alarming truth for a reassuring lie. A
store-less workspace **projects** (`chain.head: null`, evidence under §17's
documented store-dependent degradation) — the projection is honest about what
it cannot prove rather than refusing to say anything. An **unreadable** store
is not that degradation: chain-boundness is then unestablished, so `evidence`
projects empty — an errored check fails, it never skips — while the store
failure itself surfaces in `doctor.issue_codes`.

**Predicate identity.** `predicateType` is
`urn:loop-engineer:verdict:1` — the schema `$id` transliterated
(`/` and `@` → `:`), an equality asserted by test so the two names cannot
drift. It names no vendor host, no organization, and no repository: a
predicateType is written immutably into a public log, and a rename must not be
able to orphan it.

**The subject seam — read this before verifying anything.** The signer binds
`subject-path`: a file whose **entire content is the chain head**, exactly 64
lowercase hex bytes with no trailing newline, written by the single definition
`loop.verdict.subject_bytes` and reachable as `loop verdict --emit-subject`. A
consumer therefore **can** regenerate the subject's bytes from the head alone,
and `gh attestation verify` **does** succeed against them. That is the whole
point of the byte form: `gh attestation verify` accepts only a file path (or an
OCI URI) and hashes that file's **content**, so a subject identified by a bare
digest can never be presented an artifact at all.

Two things a reader must not confuse with that. First, the chain head *itself*
is still a SHA-256 over a **synthesized event preimage** (§16): no retrievable
artifact's bytes hash **to** the head, and a consumer must not go looking for
one. The subject file *carries* the head; it is not a preimage of it, and its
own digest is `sha256(<the 64 head bytes>)`, which is necessarily **not** the
head. Second, the predicate bytes are **not** the subject, deliberately:
`doctor.validation_mode` and `tool.version` live inside the predicate, so the
same run projects different bytes in different environments (measured:
`873dfc87…` with jsonschema, `8de3d88c…` in structural-fallback), and a
consumer on another tool version could never reproduce them. The head is
version-independent; the predicate bytes are not.

Authenticity (`gh attestation verify`) and agreement (`loop verdict --compare`)
are separate checks, in that order, and **neither implies the other**. §24
specifies both, together with the anchor carry-channel and the signer-trust
policy.

**What an attestation buys — and does not.** The signature attests *context*:
which repository, which workflow, which trigger, at what time. It never
attests correctness — a signed verdict over a weak gate is a signed weak
gate. A worker with ordinary merge rights can loosen the gate
(`loop/**`, `schemas/**` — the contract schemas define what doctor accepts —
`action.yml`, or the workflow) and then mint a perfectly genuine attestation
for the loosened gate, and signing does not address it. ADR 0002 decision 6 named
human review on those paths as the control; it is **withdrawn** (ADR 0002,
amendment 2026-07-30) because a single-maintainer repository cannot supply it —
GitHub forbids self-approval, so requiring code-owner review would leave
maintainer-authored pull requests unmergeable while gating only bot-authored ones.
Read a CODEOWNERS file as a record of which paths are gate-defining, never as a
control; that is true here permanently, not until some ruleset changes. The chain proves order and non-tampering
relative to an anchor, not that the events happened when claimed — a history
fabricated wholesale at authoring time is byte-valid. Detection of an
unattested rewrite is at best one run late. And an attestation nothing
verifies is decoration: until a consumer checks it, this section describes a
publication surface, not a gate.

## 24. Consuming an attested verdict — agreement, ancestry, and signer trust

§23 specifies how a verdict is *published*. This section specifies how one is
*consumed*, and it is deliberately explicit about what consumption does **not**
establish. A reader who assumes otherwise has a false sense of a gate.

**The comparison report.** `loop verdict --compare <file|-> <workspace>` loads an
attested `verdict@1` predicate, projects the workspace locally, and reports
agreement over exactly **four** facets: `run_id`, `chain.head`, the whole
`terminal` object (`state`, `completion_policy`, `false_completion`), and the
`evidence` digest set (set equality over the `digest`/`code_digest`/`policy_digest`
triple). Exit **0** on agreement, **1** on disagreement, **2** on refusal. The
report's field set is `{ok, signature_checked, compared, issues}`, and the
`compared` block carries digests, enums and `run_id` only — no free text.
`issues[].message` is the one exempt surface: a local report may explain itself; a
predicate may not.

`doctor` and `tool` are **deliberately not compared.** Both live inside the
predicate and are environment-coupled — the same run projects `873dfc87…` with
jsonschema and `8de3d88c…` in structural-fallback — so comparing them would make an
honest environment difference read as tampering. Whether an attested `doctor.ok`
should *gate* is a policy question, not an agreement question, and it is out of
scope here.

**`signature_checked` is the literal `false` on every path, and there is no flag to
flip it.** The kernel establishes agreement; `gh attestation verify` establishes
authenticity; it runs first; neither implies the other. `verdict` rejects
`--verify-signature`, `--signature`, `--signer-workflow` and `--signer-digest`
outright, so the absence is a contract rather than an omission.

**Typed refusals: a bare predicate only.** An in-toto Statement (any of `_type`,
`subject`, `predicateType`, `predicate`) and a `gh --format json` envelope (a
top-level array, or `verificationResult` / `attestation`) are refused by name, with
the documented unwrapping path `.[0].verificationResult.statement.predicate` in the
message. Best-effort parsing of a vendor envelope inside the kernel is exactly how a
trust boundary rots.

**The subject byte form (normative).** The file a consumer presents to
`gh attestation verify` is **exactly 64 bytes**: the chain head as lowercase hex,
with **no trailing newline** and nothing else. There is one definition —
`loop.verdict.subject_bytes`, reached from either side as
`loop verdict --emit-subject` — so the signer side and the consumer side cannot
disagree about those bytes. A stray `\n` would change the subject digest, which is
why the form is pinned by test rather than left to a shell's `echo`. The subject
file's own digest is `sha256(<the 64 head bytes>)` and is therefore **never** equal
to the head itself; that inequality is the crispest check that this mechanism, and
not §23's retired digest form, is what produced an attestation.

**`loop-engineer/anchor@1` — the carry channel.** A tracked JSON document
(conventionally `loop-anchor.json` at the workspace root) whose required fields are
`schema` and `chain_head`; `sequence`, `attestation_id`, `run_id` and `recorded_at`
are optional provenance. It **must be tracked and must not live under `.loop/`** —
that directory is gitignored here, so an anchor inside the tree it certifies would
never land in a commit; `read_anchor` refuses a path with a `.loop` component
outright. Every `pattern` in the schema carries a sibling `maxLength`, because
jsonschema's `pattern` is `re.search` semantics and a bare anchored pattern accepts a
trailing newline.

**The inversion that makes the anchor necessary: an attestation can corroborate a
carried head, but it can never discover one.** `GET
/repos/{owner}/{repo}/attestations/{subject_digest}` is the only list operation; the
no-digest route is a 404; there is no `gh attestation list`; GraphQL's `Repository`
type exposes no attestation fields; and **no ordering guarantee is documented
anywhere**. You must already know the digest to look anything up. So the head is
*carried* in a tracked file and the attestation proves that carried head was
notarized.

**Anchor trust is exactly ordinary write access — no better.** An actor who can edit
the anchor file re-points it at a head they had attested. That is the same class of
limit as "the worker can edit the verifier" in §23. The anchor path is listed in
this repository's CODEOWNERS, which records the gate-defining surface and enforces
nothing: the ruleset requires no code-owner review, and a single-maintainer
repository cannot require it (ADR 0002, amendment 2026-07-30).

**Ancestry, not head equality.** `--expect-chain-head` is exact *current-head*
equality, so it fails **by construction** on any store that legitimately grew:
appending one event moves the head (measured: `9d388ae5…` at sequence 4 →
`c336ecdc…` at sequence 5). Feeding run N's head to `--expect-chain-head` at run N+1
therefore always fails. The meaningful cross-run question is *"was this digest ever
my head?"*, and `loop doctor --expect-chain-ancestor <sha256>` (or `--anchor <path>`,
which resolves the digest from an `anchor@1` file) asks it via
`loop.chain.head_sequence`.

Ancestry is **established by replay, recomputing every hash — never by trusting the
stored `event_hash` column.** A tamperer who can rewrite the store can also insert a
row bearing the anchored digest, and only recomputation refuses that row. Sequence
`0` is a legitimate answer, so callers compare against `None`, never truthiness.
`--expect-chain-head` and `--expect-chain-ancestor` **compose** — equality and
ancestry are different questions and both may be asked — while `--anchor` and
`--expect-chain-ancestor` are **mutually exclusive** at the CLI, because silent
precedence between an explicit digest and a resolved one is how a gate becomes a
suggestion. Precedence between the action's `expect-chain-head` and `anchor` inputs is
resolved in `action.yml`, where the inputs are the surface, and a dropped anchor is
announced in the step summary rather than silently ignored.

**The five new codes.**

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `chain_anchor_not_ancestor` | The supplied ancestor digest was **never** the head at any sequence of the replayed chain. Also raised — never skipped — when the store is absent, empty or unreadable. |
| `anchor_file_unreadable` | The `--anchor` path is absent, unreadable, not UTF-8, or not JSON. |
| `anchor_file_invalid` | It parsed, but is not a conformant `anchor@1`. |
| `anchor_attestation_contradicted` | The index was reached, an attestation was found, and it does not corroborate the carried head. *I looked and it said no.* |
| `anchor_attestation_unavailable` | Nothing was found (404), **or** the index could not be reached at all (5xx, timeout, auth), **or** the classifier could not confidently classify what it saw. *I could not look.* |

`chain_anchor_not_ancestor` is deliberately **not** a reuse of
`chain_anchor_mismatch`. "Your current head is not what I expected" and "the head you
anchored is not in my history at all" are different facts, and doctor issue codes are
the population `verdict.doctor.issue_codes` is drawn from — a permanent, public,
append-only log. One shared code would collapse them there forever.

**The sentence that keeps this a gate.** *Anything short of a verified 200 plus a
successful `gh attestation verify` is non-promoting, and transport-class failures
(5xx, timeout, auth) are separately reportable but exactly as non-promoting as a
clean denial.* The two lookup codes exist for **observability**, never for
differential trust.

This matters because the anchor is a **deletable dependency**. Attestations can be
deleted — user- and org-scoped delete, bulk-delete and delete-request endpoints all
exist, permission-gated — and GitHub's own guidance recommends deleting attestations
that are no longer needed. **No retention window is documented anywhere**; the
familiar 90-day and 400-day figures are workflow *artifacts and logs*, not
attestations, and the roadmap issue tracking expiry records none. So a missing anchor
attestation must be a typed failure: otherwise an availability attack on the index
becomes a gate bypass.

**Do not over-read the codes.** A 404 is consistent with never-attested,
attested-then-deleted, and a transient index fault; HTTP status alone cannot separate
them. And do not key logic on response *body* text — the no-digest route returns a
generic `documentation_url` while the digest-present-but-non-matching family returns
one pointing at the list-attestations reference.

**The signer-trust policy.** `loop.attestation.check_signer_trust` is a pure function
over an **already-verified** `verificationResult`. It reads only
`signature.certificate` and `verifiedTimestamps` — per `gh`'s own help, those are the
only fields the originating workflow cannot manipulate — and treats everything under
`statement.predicate` as data to compare, never to trust. It **refuses**, loudly and
typed, when a claim it needs is absent, because a policy that treats a missing claim
as satisfied is worse than no policy; an unwitnessed attestation (absent or empty
`verifiedTimestamps`) is likewise refused. Denials are typed codes —
`signer_workflow_mismatch`, `signer_repository_mismatch`, `self_hosted_runner`,
`signer_trigger_mismatch` — never booleans, and the returned verdict carries
`signature_checked: false` too, because it evaluates a conclusion `gh` already
reached.

**`--signer-digest` is deliberately not required.** It pins the signer-digest
certificate extension, which is populated from the `job_workflow_sha` claim; for a
non-reusable top-level workflow that value **equals the triggering commit SHA**. It
therefore does not merely invalidate on a workflow edit — **it invalidates on every push**.
That was observed across all three attestations this repository minted before this
slice, even though none of those commits touched `attest.yml` or `action.yml`.
`--signer-workflow` (whose value was byte-identical across all three) is the mandatory
pin; `--signer-digest` is offered only as an optional, human-invoked one-off.
`check_signer_trust` has no `signer_digest` parameter at all.

**The REST attestations route is deprecated.** Measured on both the 200 and the 404
route and absent from four control endpoints, so it is route-level:
`Deprecation: Tue, 10 Mar 2026`, **`Sunset: Fri, 10 Mar 2028`**. The fetch/verify path
therefore goes through `gh attestation verify`, a GitHub-maintained abstraction that
will be migrated over whatever replaces the raw route, and the single `gh` call site
lives in `scripts/action_anchor_resolve.py` so a migration is a one-line change. The
sunset date is recorded here so a future maintainer meets it as a documented fact
rather than as an outage.

**The `[0]` selection is an assumption, and is stated as one.** No ordering guarantee
is documented for the underlying endpoint, so `[0]` means *"some verified attestation
for this subject"* — never *"the newest"*. It is sound only because every entry has
already passed the same signer-trust policy over the same subject digest, so two
entries cannot materially disagree about the head. **If the policy is ever relaxed to
accept more than one signer, this assumption breaks** and the step must compare every
entry rather than indexing.

**Public/private asymmetry.** Public repositories sign against the Sigstore Public
Good instance and its public transparency log. **Private repositories use GitHub's own
signing instance, which has no transparency log** and federates only with Actions. The
independent-audit property this design leans on exists for public repositories and does
**not** exist for private ones. For a public repository the attestations read also
succeeds unauthenticated, so an `attestations: read` permission is defensive
future-proofing rather than a requirement.

**Honest limits.**

1. **This repository cannot dogfood cross-run ancestry.** `.github/workflows/attest.yml`
   seeds an ephemeral `$RUNNER_TEMP` workspace on every run, so its chain head is new
   by construction and there is no persistent store to anchor. Coverage is therefore
   (a) synthetic, through a fake `gh` on `PATH`, and (b) a real *within-run* grown-store
   ancestry exercise. Do not read that CI green as a cross-run proof.
2. **Detection of an unattested rewrite is at best one run late**, unchanged from §23.
   An actor who can land a commit lets CI run once, which mints a genuine attestation
   over the rewritten chain. Opt-in changes operator consent; it does not change that.
3. **Mode parity is now CI-covered, and was not before.** Every other CI job installs
   jsonschema, so the structural hand-checks that back `anchor@1` in a jsonschema-less
   environment ran nowhere in CI: loosening a `fullmatch` to a `match` in `loop/anchor.py`
   kills four tests in the pyyaml-only leg but only two with jsonschema installed,
   because the schema layer masks the rest. The `gates-fallback` job closes that class,
   and asserts jsonschema is genuinely absent so it cannot decay into a duplicate.
4. **`--source-ref refs/heads/main` is a repo-specific constant, not a placeholder.** An
   adopter whose default branch differs must change it. It is deliberately **not**
   parameterized: a `--source-ref` taken from an untrusted input would let a caller widen
   the pin to any ref and defeat the control.
