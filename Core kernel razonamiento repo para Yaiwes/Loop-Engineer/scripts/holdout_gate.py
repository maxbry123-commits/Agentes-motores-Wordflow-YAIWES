"""Held-out verifier split — the runnable core of *measured* false-completion.

A loop can game a verifier it can see. So acceptance checks are split:

  * visible  — the loop sees these and optimizes against them during the run.
  * holdout  — withheld until terminal verification by this independent gate.

A loop may declare ``Succeeded`` only if the HOLDOUT set passes. Passing the
visible set while failing the holdout set is the measurable *false-completion*
event (``false_completion: true``) — the signature of overfitting to the tests
the agent could see. Aggregated across runs, that flag IS the
false-completion-rate metric (no longer self-reported).

This ships as composable tooling, not a runtime: a loop calls it at its terminal
gate. Pair it with ``anticheat_scan.py`` for the trajectory sweep.

Manifest schema (JSON)::

    {
      "visible": [{"id": "unit", "cmd": "pytest tests/unit -q"}],
      "holdout": [{"id": "spec", "cmd": "pytest tests/holdout -q"}]
    }

The manifest is trusted, operator-authored config (like a Makefile target); its
commands run in a shell. Do not feed it untrusted input.

Run::

    python3 holdout_gate.py <manifest.json> [--cwd DIR]

Prints the verdict as JSON. Exit code 0 iff verdict == "Succeeded".
