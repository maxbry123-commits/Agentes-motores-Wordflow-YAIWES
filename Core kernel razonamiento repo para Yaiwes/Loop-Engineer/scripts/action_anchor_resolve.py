"""Resolve a carried anchor@1 head against the attestation index, via `gh`.

The ONLY place in this repo that invokes `gh attestation verify` (action.yml also calls
`gh api` for the advisory PR comment). It lives in scripts/, not loop/, because
it reads the environment and touches the network — the tool layer, following the
scripts/action_scorecard.py precedent of an extracted, TESTED script the composite
action calls.

WHY THE CLASSIFIER PARSES STDERR (normative, from `gh help exit-codes`, gh 2.92.0):

    0  success   1  any failure   2  cancelled   4  authentication required

There is NO distinct exit code separating "no attestation exists" from "an attestation
was found but the signer policy denied it" from "the index was unreachable". All three
arrive as exit 1 — measured live: a 64-hex subject with no matching attestation prints
`Error: HTTP 404: Not Found (…)` and exits 1, the same code a signature failure exits
with. So the classifier must read a vendor string that has no stability contract and
can drift.

Three consequences, all normative:

1. The fallback rule is fail-closed and ABSOLUTE: any output the classifier cannot
   confidently classify becomes `unavailable`. Never `corroborated`. Never a skip. An
   unrecognized stderr shape is the MOST suspicious case, not the most benign one.
2. Exit 4 (auth) and exit 2 (cancelled) are transport-class -> `unavailable`. Only
   exit 0 PLUS a parseable payload PLUS a passing signer-trust policy reaches
   `corroborated`.
3. The 404 branch is driven by a VERBATIM captured fixture
   (scripts/fixtures/gh_attestation_verify/no_attestation_404.txt), not a paraphrase.
   The DENIAL shape was likewise captured from live `gh`, post-merge in #111
   (scripts/fixtures/gh_attestation_verify/signer_denied.txt), once this repo had a
   verifiable attestation to be denied against. The guess it replaced matched nothing
   and fell through to `unavailable` — reporting "it said no" as "I could not look".

Anything short of a verified 200 plus a successful `gh attestation verify` is
non-promoting, and transport-class failures are separately reportable but exactly as
non-promoting as a clean denial.

Exit codes: 0 corroborated, 1 contradicted-or-unavailable, 2 usage/refusal.
