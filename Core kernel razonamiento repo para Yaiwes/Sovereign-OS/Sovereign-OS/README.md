## Overview

Sovereign-OS is not another chatbot wrapper or agent framework. It is an **operating system for autonomous AI work**: a governance layer that enforces budget, quality, and permissions before any token is spent or any task is executed.

The core contract is simple. One YAML file — the **Charter** — declares the agent's mission, spending limits, KPIs, and allowed capabilities. Everything else — planning, approval, execution, auditing, payment — flows from that file.

```
Charter → CEO (plan) → CFO (approve budget) → Workers (execute) → Auditor (verify) → Ledger (record)
```

The Ledger is append-only. The Auditor is cryptographically bound. Neither can be overridden at runtime.

---

## Why Sovereign-OS?

|                  | Typical agent frameworks                   | Sovereign-OS                                                                       |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Cost control** | API key = burn until empty.                | Every cent and token is tracked. CFO approves before every task. Daily caps enforced. |
| **Quality**      | Hope the output is correct.                | Every task verified against Charter KPIs. Fail audit → TrustScore drops. Proof hash on every report. |
| **Permissions**  | All-or-nothing.                            | Agents start sandboxed. They earn capabilities (`SPEND_USD`, `CALL_API`, `WRITE_FILES`) via TrustScore. |
| **Monetization** | None.                                      | Built-in job queue, Stripe integration, ingest from any source, webhook on delivery. |

---

## Quick Start

**CLI — run a single mission in 30 seconds:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Justin0504/Sovereign-OS.git && cd Sovereign-OS
pip install -e .
sovereign run --charter charter.example.yaml "Summarize the current AI agent landscape."
```

Output: task plan → CFO approval → execution → audit report → ledger entry.

**Web dashboard — accept paid jobs, run 24/7:**

```bash
pip install -e ".[llm]"
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: set OPENAI_API_KEY or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, and optionally STRIPE_API_KEY
python -m sovereign_os.web.app
# Open http://localhost:8000
```

From the dashboard you can submit missions, inspect the job queue, approve or retry jobs, and monitor token usage and the audit trail in real time.

---

## Architecture

Five layers. Data flows down; accountability flows back up.

```
Charter (YAML)
    └─ Governance Engine
          ├─ CEO (Strategist)    — decomposes goals into ordered tasks; prunes to budget & re-plans on failure
          ├─ CFO (Treasury)      — approves/rejects per-task spend; daily cap, runway, margin + session circuit breaker
          └─ Worker Registry     — routes each task to the right worker by skill
                └─ Workers       — execute; emit TaskResult with token usage
                      └─ Auditor — verifies output against Charter KPIs (category-tuned rubric); signed AuditReport
                            └─ Ledger (UnifiedLedger) — append-only USD + token accounting
```

**Key design decisions:**

<table><tr><td valign="top" width="55%">

- The Charter is the single source of truth. Changing runtime behavior means changing the Charter, not the code.
- The Ledger is append-only JSONL. No delete, no update. Every entry carries a sequence number.
- TrustScore gates capability grants. A new agent cannot spend USD or write files until it earns them through passing audits. High-risk capabilities are further scoped by **just-in-time leases** — granted per task, auto-expiring, revoked when the task ends (zero standing privilege).
- Workers are pluggable. The 16 built-in workers cover common content and code tasks. You can add your own in a single Python file.

## Marketplace oversight & delivery categories

Beyond running its own missions, Sovereign-OS acts as a **governance layer over
the agent-task economy — in both directions**, applying the same two gates
(budget + delivery quality) wherever work flows.

```
INBOUND   human/agent posts ─▶ ingest (TaskBounty · StacksTasker · BotBounty · ClawTasks · APB/x402)
          ─▶ [CFO budget] ─▶ governed workers ─▶ [Auditor quality] ─▶ submit

OUTBOUND  Sovereign-OS posts ─▶ [CFO budget gate] ─▶ fund escrow (RentAHuman)
          ─▶ worker delivers ─▶ [Auditor quality gate] ─▶ release | dispute
```

- **Inbound sources** (`ingest_bridge/`) pull open tasks from real marketplaces
  (live-validated APIs); Sovereign-OS governs its own agents doing the work. Includes
  an **APB (Agent Payment Bounty) source** that discovers x402-native bounties from
  publishers' `/.well-known/bounties.json` — the standard the x402 Foundation rail is
  built on (see [docs/AUTONOMY.md](docs/AUTONOMY.md)).
- **Outbound oversight** (`oversight/`) posts tasks for external workers: the CFO
  approves the spend and reserves escrow *before* funding, and the Auditor must
  pass the deliverable *before* payment is released (else it's disputed/refunded).
  All money-moving calls are dry-run until explicitly set live; run
  `python -m sovereign_os.oversight.rentahuman_preflight` for a go-live check.

A **task-category backbone** (`agents/categories.py`) ties delivery together:
each category (coding, data, design, email, research, writing, automation) maps
to a top-tier worker, a **risk-scaled budget ceiling** (`CategoryBudgetPolicy`),
a **permission tier earned per category** (per-category TrustScore), and the
**connectors** it needs (`connectors/`, MCP / built-in / HTTP, with readiness).
Inspect it with `sovereign categories` and `sovereign connectors`.

See [docs/OVERSIGHT.md](docs/OVERSIGHT.md), [docs/CATEGORIES.md](docs/CATEGORIES.md),
[docs/CONNECTORS.md](docs/CONNECTORS.md), [docs/CLAWTASKS.md](docs/CLAWTASKS.md),
[docs/COST.md](docs/COST.md), and [docs/X402.md](docs/X402.md).

### Capability map

```
 INBOUND platforms                     GOVERNANCE                         AGENTIC WORKERS (by category)
 TaskBounty · StacksTasker  ──ingest──▶ ┌───────────────┐  ──route──▶  coding   → read·write·run_tests·submit_PR
 BotBounty · ClawTasks                  │ CFO budget gate│              research → web_fetch
                                        │  (per-category │              data     → web_fetch
 OUTBOUND (agent hires)                 │   ceilings)    │              design   → read_figma · generate_image
 RentAHuman escrow  ◀──post/fund──────  │ Auditor quality│              writing  → draft → self-critique → revise
   release | dispute  ◀──gate───────────│  (rubric)      │              ─────────────────────────────────────
                                        └───────────────┘              tools dispatched via connectors/, code
 Ledger (append-only, thread-safe) · per-model/category cost · TrustScore earned per category · Docker sandbox
```

Every task is **categorized** → routed to a **top-tier worker** → budget-gated by a
**per-category ceiling** → executed with **real tools** (web/repo/Figma/image, in a
**Docker sandbox** for untrusted code) → **quality-gated** before delivery or payout.
All money/exec is **dry-run by default**.

**Try it (no keys, no funds):**

```bash
python examples/coding_bounty_demo.py   # bug-fix: route → budget → read·write·test·PR → audit
python examples/oversight_demo.py       # outbound: budget gate + quality gate (release vs dispute)
python examples/category_demo.py        # category → worker · budget · permission · connectors
python examples/oversight_e2e.py        # full readiness check (inbound + outbound + preflights)
sovereign categories                    # the delivery-category table
sovereign connectors                    # connector readiness + required MCP servers
```

## Features

**Governance**
- Charter-driven: mission, competencies, KPIs, fiscal boundaries — all in one YAML.
- CEO (Strategist) decomposes natural-language goals into executable task plans with dependencies. Reactive: `prune_to_budget` sheds lowest-value tasks to fit a budget without breaking the dependency DAG; `corrective_task` builds a high-priority retry carrying the audit's failure reason and fix.
- **Profitability-first task selection** — before spending any compute, an ingest screen (`governance/economics.py`) estimates a task's fully-loaded cost (LLM by category × complexity + settlement fee + gas) and skips anything that can't clear the margin floor. Stops the classic autonomous-agent failure mode where fees/gas turn shipped work into a net loss. Opt in with `SOVEREIGN_PROFIT_SCREEN=true`; tune with `SOVEREIGN_{SETTLEMENT_FEE_RATIO,GAS_COST_CENTS,MIN_MARGIN_RATIO}`.
- **Reactive self-repair** — a task that fails audit is automatically re-run with the Auditor's reason + fix folded into its brief (`SOVEREIGN_MAX_REPAIR_ATTEMPTS=N`), recovering quality with no human in the loop. Only a fully-passing mission reaches delivery/settlement — a failed audit never gets submitted to a platform or charged.
- CFO (Treasury) enforces `max_task_cost_usd`, `daily_budget_usd`, `runway_days`, and `min_job_margin_ratio` *before* any task runs. A runtime **SpendCircuitBreaker** adds fast-fail *during* a session — it halts the loop when cumulative spend hits a session ceiling, audits fail past a streak limit, or ROI collapses (the guard that stops runaway agent loops the pre-flight gates miss). Configure via `SOVEREIGN_SESSION_CEILING_CENTS`, `SOVEREIGN_MAX_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES`, `SOVEREIGN_ROI_FLOOR` (all default off); watch it live on the dashboard **Guardrails** tab (session spend vs. ceiling, failure streak, ROI, one-click reset).
- **Permissions** — TrustScore-gated capabilities (`READ_FILES`, `WRITE_FILES`, `EXECUTE_SHELL`, `SPEND_USD`, `CALL_EXTERNAL_API`), earned per category, with graduated autonomous-spend ceilings. High-risk grants use **just-in-time leases**: scoped to one task, bounded by TTL and use-count, auto-revoked on completion (`grant_lease` / `use_lease` / `revoke_task_leases`). Active leases and per-agent trust are shown live on the dashboard **Guardrails** tab.
- **Two dashboards, same guardrails** — the web dashboard (Guardrails tab + per-task quality scorecard) and a **Textual terminal Command Center** (`python -m sovereign_os.ui.app`) both surface the CFO circuit breaker (session spend vs. ceiling, failure streak, ROI; press `b` to reset), active JIT leases, and the category-rubric breakdown streamed live under each audit verdict.
- **Prometheus metrics** — all three guardrails export on `/metrics` for Grafana: breaker session spend/ceiling/ROI/trips, active JIT leases, per-agent trust, and per-category audit-quality histograms (overall + per rubric criterion). See [docs/METRICS.md](docs/METRICS.md) for the metric list and PromQL starter panels.

**Execution**
- 16 built-in workers: `summarize`, `research`, `reply`, `write_article`, `write_email`, `write_post`, `meeting_minutes`, `translate`, `rewrite_polish`, `collect_info`, `extract_structured`, `spec_writer`, `solve_problem`, `assistant_chat`, `code_assistant`, `code_review`.
- **Verification-driven coding** — the coding worker runs a harness-enforced loop (`run_with_verified_tools`): it won't accept "done" until the **test suite actually passes**. A premature answer bounces back with the failing test output and the model must fix and re-verify — code that can't reach green is marked `tests_verified=false` / `success=false`, so broken work never ships to a paid bounty. Gates only when execution is enabled (`SOVEREIGN_CODE_EXEC_ENABLED`); otherwise it's a no-op skip.
- Multi-model: Strategist and workers can use different backends (e.g. GPT-4o for planning, Claude for execution).
- **Pluggable agent backends** — for complex delivery a worker can delegate a whole task to a purpose-built coding agent (**Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Gemini CLI, Aider**, or any headless CLI via a command template) instead of a single chat call. One stable `AgentBackend` seam; new agents plug in by config (`SOVEREIGN_AGENT_BACKEND` / `SOVEREIGN_BACKEND_<CATEGORY>`), dry-run until `SOVEREIGN_AGENT_BACKEND_ENABLED=true`.
- **MCP connectors in every worker** — register MCP servers via `SOVEREIGN_MCP_SERVERS` and their tools appear inline in every worker's tool-use loop, next to built-ins like `web_fetch`. Any MCP-provided connector (DBs, search, SaaS, another agent over MCP) becomes callable mid-task with no code change — the universal connector layer both Claude Agent SDK and Codex speak. See [docs/BACKENDS.md](docs/BACKENDS.md).
- Dynamic worker loading: drop a Python file into `sovereign_os/agents/user_workers/` — no registration boilerplate.

**Auditing**
- Every task output is verified against Charter KPIs by the ReviewEngine.
- **Category-tuned analytic rubric**: high-value deliverables are scored criterion-by-criterion on a rubric matched to the work type — coding gets correctness/completeness/robustness/relevance, writing gets clarity/voice, etc. — always ending in a `safety` criterion. Criterion order is deterministically shuffled per task to blunt LLM-judge positional bias.
- Value-aware bar: higher-paid jobs must clear a stricter passing score; cheap tasks can skip the (relatively expensive) LLM judge.
- AuditReport carries `score`, `passed`, `reason`, `suggested_fix`, `sub_scores`, and `proof_hash` (SHA-256 of inputs + output). Each job's delivery view renders a **quality scorecard** — the per-criterion rubric breakdown (bars per criterion, category label, overall score) so you can see *why* a deliverable passed or failed, not just the verdict.
- Append-only audit trail (JSONL). Integrity verifiable offline.

**Monetization & job queue**
- SQLite-backed job queue (Redis optional for multi-instance).
- Stripe integration: set `STRIPE_API_KEY` and each completed job triggers a real charge; transactions appear in your Stripe Dashboard.
- Auto-approval mode or manual review per job.
- Ingest from any HTTP endpoint, Reddit (PRAW), Shopify, WooCommerce, or custom scrapers via the ingest bridge.
- Webhook delivery: `POST` job result to any URL on completion.

- Optional IP allowlist and per-IP rate limiting.
- Job input validation (Pydantic v2).
- No secrets in code; everything via environment variables.

## Deployment

### Local (bare metal)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Justin0504/Sovereign-OS.git
cd Sovereign-OS
pip install -e ".[llm]"
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
python -m sovereign_os.web.app
```

Listens on `http://0.0.0.0:8000` by default. Set `SOVEREIGN_HOST` and `SOVEREIGN_PORT` to change.

### Docker Compose (recommended for production)

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env
docker compose up -d
# Web UI:   http://localhost:8000
# Metrics:  http://localhost:8000/metrics
# Health:   http://localhost:8000/health
```

`docker-compose.yml` includes the web app, Redis (for multi-instance job queue), and named volumes for the ledger and job database.

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml excerpt
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports: ["8000:8000"]
    env_file: .env
    volumes:
      - sovereign_data:/app/data
  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    volumes:
      - redis_data:/data
```

See [docs/DEPLOY.md](docs/DEPLOY.md) for volume strategy, health checks, and graceful shutdown.

### Ingest bridge (optional)

Pull real orders from Reddit, scrapers, or Shopify:

```bash
pip install -e ".[bridge]"
python -m sovereign_os.ingest_bridge   # serves on :9000
# In .env: SOVEREIGN_INGEST_URL=http://localhost:9000/jobs?take=true
```

See [docs/INGEST_BRIDGE.md](docs/INGEST_BRIDGE.md) for Reddit credentials, scraper targets, and retail connectors.

## Custom Workers

Workers are the execution layer. Each worker maps to a skill name and receives a task description; it returns a `TaskResult` with output and token usage.

```python
# sovereign_os/agents/user_workers/my_worker.py
from sovereign_os.agents.base import BaseWorker, TaskResult

class MyWorker(BaseWorker):
    skill = "my_skill"

    async def run(self, task_description: str, **kwargs) -> TaskResult:
        result = await self._chat(f"Do this: {task_description}")
        return TaskResult(output=result, success=True)
```

Drop the file into `sovereign_os/agents/user_workers/` — it is loaded automatically on startup. Reference it in your Charter:

```yaml
competencies:
  - name: my_skill
    description: "Does the custom thing."
```

See [docs/WORKER.md](docs/WORKER.md) for the full API, LLM helper methods, and advanced patterns.

---

## Testing

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest tests/ -v
```

Tests (257, all passing) cover the governance engine, CFO circuit breaker, JIT capability leases, category-tuned audit rubric, reactive planning, ledger accounting, marketplace oversight, payments (Stripe + x402), job store, compliance hooks, web API, and webhook delivery. Run with LLM keys unset so tests use stubs (no network).
