# Grader cookbook

Worked `evaluate()` patterns. Pick the one whose *shape* matches your task, then adapt. All assume `class Grader(TaskGrader)`. API details: [grader-api.md](grader-api.md).

## Decision: which pattern?

| Your task scores by... | Pattern |
|---|---|
| A number the program prints | **Stdout float** |
| Fraction of held-out tests that pass | **Test pass-rate** |
| How much better than a baseline | **Ratio vs baseline** |
| Several criteria you weight together | **Multi-metric** |
| An LLM judging open-ended text/docs | rubric judge → [rubric-judges.md](rubric-judges.md) |

If the program is expensive to run and the agent sweeps hyperparameters, add a **tune-mode** cheap path (last section) on top of any pattern.

## 1. Stdout float (the `coral init` default)

The program prints one number; you parse it. Good for optimization tasks (pack circles → print sum of radii).

```python
def evaluate(self) -> float | ScoreBundle:
    program_file = self.args.get("program_file", "solution.py")
    result = self.run_program(program_file)
    if result.returncode != 0:
        return self.fail(f"{program_file} crashed: {result.stderr[:300]}")
    try:
        value = float(result.stdout.strip())
    except ValueError:
        return self.fail(f"Expected a float on stdout, got {result.stdout[:80]!r}")
    return self.score(value, explanation=f"parsed {value:.4f} from stdout")
```

## 2. Test pass-rate against a hidden test set

Ship the tests under `grader.private` (so agents can't read them — list a dir **outside** `grader/`, e.g. `taskdata`, and read via `self.private_dir`), copy them next to the agent's code, run pytest, score the pass fraction. `direction: maximize`.

```python
import json, shutil
from pathlib import Path


def evaluate(self) -> float | ScoreBundle:
    tests = Path(self.private_dir) / "taskdata" / "test_hidden.py"
    dest = Path(self.codebase_path) / "test_hidden.py"
    shutil.copy(tests, dest)  # codebase_path is force-removed after, so this is safe + temporary

    # A tiny in-process pytest plugin counts pass/fail and prints JSON we parse back.
    out = self.run_script_json(
        "import pytest, json\n"
        "class P:\n"
        "    def __init__(self): self.passed=0; self.failed=0\n"
        "    def pytest_runtest_logreport(self, report):\n"
        "        if report.when=='call':\n"
        "            self.passed += report.passed; self.failed += report.failed\n"
        "p=P(); pytest.main(['-q','test_hidden.py','--tb=no'], plugins=[p])\n"
        "print(json.dumps({'passed': p.passed, 'failed': p.failed}))\n"
    )
    total = out["passed"] + out["failed"]
    if total == 0:
        return self.fail("no tests collected — did the agent delete the entry point?")
    frac = out["passed"] / total
    return self.score(frac, explanation=f"{out['passed']}/{total} hidden tests passed")
```

> `run_script_json` is the clean primitive here: it runs in the codebase env (so the agent's deps are available), parses the JSON you print, and raises with stderr if the script crashes.

## 3. Ratio vs a baseline (speedups, error reduction)

Score relative to a reference so the leaderboard reads as "× better". For a speedup, `direction: maximize` and report `baseline_time / agent_time`.

```python
def evaluate(self) -> float | ScoreBundle:
    out = self.run_script_json(
        "import json, time, importlib.util\n"
        "spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location('sol', 'solution.py')\n"
        "m = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec); spec.loader.exec_module(m)\n"
        "t0 = time.perf_counter(); result = m.run(); dt = time.perf_counter() - t0\n"
        "print(json.dumps({'dt': dt, 'result': result}))\n"
    )
    # correctness gate first — never reward a fast wrong answer
    if out["result"] != self._expected():
        return self.fail("output incorrect — speed doesn't count until it's correct")
    baseline = float(self.args.get("baseline_seconds", 1.0))
    ratio = baseline / out["dt"]
    return self.score(
        ratio, explanation=f"{ratio:.2f}× baseline ({out['dt']:.3f}s vs {baseline:.3f}s)"
    )
```

The correctness gate is the important part: gate on correctness, *then* score the thing you're optimizing. Otherwise agents discover that `return 0` is very fast.

## 4. Multi-metric ScoreBundle

Return several named `Score`s plus one `aggregated` number. Each metric shows in `coral show`; `aggregated` is what ranks and what plateau detection watches.

```python
from coral.types import Score, ScoreBundle


def evaluate(self) -> ScoreBundle:
    m = self.run_script_json("...emit {'acc':..,'latency_ms':..,'size_kb':..} ...")
    scores = {
        "accuracy": Score(value=m["acc"], name="accuracy"),
        "latency": Score(value=1000.0 / m["latency_ms"], name="latency", explanation="1/sec"),
        "compactness": Score(value=1.0 / m["size_kb"], name="compactness"),
    }
    weights = {"accuracy": 0.7, "latency": 0.2, "compactness": 0.1}
    aggregated = sum(scores[k].value * w for k, w in weights.items())
    return ScoreBundle(
        scores=scores,
        aggregated=aggregated,
        feedback=f"acc={m['acc']:.3f} latency={m['latency_ms']:.0f}ms size={m['size_kb']:.1f}kb",
        metadata={"weights": weights},
    )
```

`ScoreBundle` also has `.compute_aggregated(weights)` if you'd rather let it do the weighted average. Convert every metric to a number where bigger = better (or set `direction: minimize` and keep raw values) so the leaderboard ordering is unambiguous.

## 5. Tune mode — a cheap target for hyperparameter sweeps

When the agent runs `coral eval --tune`, `self.tune` is `True` and the attempt **doesn't count against the plateau/heartbeat budget**. Use it to score against a smaller, faster slice so agents can sweep cheaply, then submit a real eval for the full target. Override `describe_tune()` so the agent knows what your tune path does.

```python
def describe_tune(self) -> str:
    return "Tune mode scores on a 500-example dev slice (≈10× faster); real evals use the full test set."


def evaluate(self) -> float | ScoreBundle:
    n = 500 if self.tune else None  # None = full set
    acc = self._score_on(n_examples=n)
    label = "dev slice" if self.tune else "full test set"
    return self.score(acc, explanation=f"accuracy on {label}")
```

If you do nothing, tune evals are identical to real ones (the default `describe_tune()` says so). Adding a cheap path is what makes `--tune` worth using.

## Hidden data — under `grader.private`, outside the grader package

Answer keys, hidden fixtures, and any secret the agent must not see go under `grader.private` in `task.yaml`, in a dir **outside** `grader/`. CORAL copies those paths into `.coral/private/` (denied to every agent runtime) and the grader reads them from `self.private_dir`:

```yaml
grader:
  private:
    - "taskdata"   # a sibling of grader/  →  .coral/private/taskdata
```

```python
from pathlib import Path

_TASKDATA = Path(self.private_dir) / "taskdata"
```

Keep it out of `grader/`: **everything inside the `grader/` package is visible to agents** — the whole source is surfaced read-only at `<shared_dir>/grader/` (so they can read how they're scored), so a `grader.private` path *inside* the package is copied to `.coral/private/` **and** leaked via the surfaced source — `coral validate` errors on that. Non-secret bundled data may sit inside `grader/` and be read via `Path(__file__).parent / ...`, but it's visible — never put a secret there. Never put answer keys under `seed/` either — agents read `seed/`.
