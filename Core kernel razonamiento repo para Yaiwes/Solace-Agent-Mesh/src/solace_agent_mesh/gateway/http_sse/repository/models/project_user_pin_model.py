"""
SQLAlchemy model for per-user project pin preferences.

Each row represents a single user's decision to pin a specific project.
This replaces the global `is_pinned` column on the projects table so that
each user (owner or shared collaborator) can independently pin/unpin a project
without affecting anyone else's view.
