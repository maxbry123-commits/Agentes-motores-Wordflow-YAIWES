/**
 * Plugin that copies the pdf.worker.min.mjs file from pdfjs-dist into the
 * library dist/ output directory and resolves the ?url import to a stable
 * relative path.
 *
 * When building as a library (not an app), Vite does not process ?url imports
 * the same way — the worker URL ends up as undefined, breaking PDF rendering
 * in consumers like SAM Enterprise. This plugin ensures:
 *   1. The worker file is physically present in dist/ so consumers can serve it.
 *   2. The ?url import resolves to "./pdf.worker.min.mjs" (relative to dist/).
