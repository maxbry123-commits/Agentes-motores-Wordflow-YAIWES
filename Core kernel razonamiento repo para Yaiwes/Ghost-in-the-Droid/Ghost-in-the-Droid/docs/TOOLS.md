# Agent Tools Reference

The catalog of tools the LLM agent can call. Identical surface across both
inference paths so prompts/skills behave the same regardless of where the
model runs:

- **MCP server** (`gitd/mcp_server.py`) — exposed to `claude-code` over MCP. The CLI auto-prefixes them as `mcp__android-agent__<tool>`.
- **Local tool list** (`gitd/services/agent_tools.py` → `TOOLS`) — exposed to the on-device Gemma provider (`agent_chat_ondevice.py`) and any other in-process tool-using loop.

Both paths execute the same underlying logic — for tools with non-trivial
behavior (e.g. `web_search`) they share a service module so there's one
implementation, not two drifts.

Every public tool has an explicit platform classification exposed at
`GET /api/tools/platforms`:

| classification | meaning |
|---|---|
| `cross_platform` | Works on Android and iOS, or is device-neutral. |
| `android_only` | Intentionally Android-only; no iOS equivalent is planned for this tool shape. |
| `ios_supported` | Implemented for iOS, while Android support is not exposed through this tool yet. |
| `ios_planned` | Android implementation exists; iOS replacement is planned but not implemented. |

Agent chat sessions filter their offered tool schemas by device ref. Android
serials receive Android-supported tools; `ios:<udid>` sessions receive only
iOS-supported and cross-platform tools. The full catalog remains visible in
the tools hub for auditing.

The dashboard Tools Hub displays Android/iOS support badges from the same
platform registry. When testing a device-scoped tool, it blocks unsupported
tool/device combinations before dispatching to `/api/tools/test`.

> **iOS:** with `GITD_ENABLE_IOS=1`, `ios:<udid>` device refs route cross-platform tools (tap, swipe, type, screenshot, browser primitives) through Appium/WDA. Android-only tools (`shell`, `launch_intent`, Portal overlay, crash reports) return a platform error for iOS refs. See `gitd/services/tool_platforms.py` for the per-tool support matrix.

## App lifecycle

### `launch_app(device, package, fresh=false)`

Launch an Android app by package name or an iOS app by bundle id.

| arg | type | required | default | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `device` | str | yes | — | ADB serial or `ios:<udid>` |
| `package` | str | yes | — | Android package or iOS bundle id, e.g. `com.android.chrome`, `com.google.chrome.ios` |
| `fresh` | bool | no | `false` | If `true`, force-stop the app first (cold start). Use for benchmarks or when prior in-app state would interfere. If `false` (default), warm start — resumes wherever the user left off. |

The LLM picks based on context: a benchmark task or "open Reddit fresh" → `fresh=true`. "Go back to Chrome" / general use → `fresh=false`.

### `force_stop(device, package)`

Kill an app outright. No relaunch.

### `app_state(device, package)`

Check whether an Android package or iOS bundle id is installed, running, or
foreground. iOS uses Appium `mobile: queryAppState`; Android uses `pm path`,
`pidof`, and the current foreground window. REST equivalents are
`GET /api/phone/app-state/{device}?package=...` and
`POST /api/phone/app-state`.

### `open_camera(device, mode="photo", timer_s=0)`

Open the platform camera app. Android uses its OEM camera launcher flow. iOS
launches `com.apple.camera` through Appium/WDA and then taps visible Camera UI
controls for `photo`, `video`, `selfie`, `selfie_video`, and timer values. iOS
mode, front-camera, and timer selection are best-effort because Apple Camera UI
labels vary by device state and OS version.

### `clipboard_get(device)` / `clipboard_set(device, text)`

Read or set plain-text clipboard contents. Android uses the existing Portal /
ADB clipboard helpers. iOS uses Appium's clipboard extension endpoints through
the active WebDriverAgent session. `paste_text` on iOS sets the clipboard and
then inserts text through WDA into the focused field; this provides the same
agent outcome, but it is not a native keyboard paste shortcut.

REST equivalents are `GET /api/phone/clipboard/{device}`,
`POST /api/phone/clipboard`, and `POST /api/phone/paste-text`.

### `search_apps(device, query)` / `list_apps(device)` / `list_packages(device)`

Find Android package names or iOS bundle IDs. Use `search_apps` first, fall
back to `list_apps`.

Android uses `pm list packages`. iOS cannot provide arbitrary full-device app
enumeration through WDA, so Ghost combines configured bundle IDs
(`IOS_KNOWN_APPS_JSON` or per-device `known_apps`) with common bundle IDs and
verifies them with Appium `mobile: queryAppState` when possible. Unverified iOS
results include `verified=false` and a `verification_error` instead of silently
pretending the device was fully enumerated.

REST equivalents are `GET /api/phone/apps/{device}?query=...` for rich app
entries and `GET /api/phone/packages/{device}` for package or bundle IDs.

## Web

The web tools are the first iOS release-quality workflow surface. On Android
they use `VIEW` intents and normalized screen extraction. On iOS they use
Appium/WebDriverAgent, prefer WebView JavaScript extraction when Chrome exposes
a `WEBVIEW_*` context, then fall back to native accessibility XML and OCR.

### `open_url(device, url, bundle_id=None)`

Open a URL in the platform browser. iOS results include a `navigation` object
with `state`, `method`, `expected_url`, and `url`; `state=url_matched` means
Appium/WebView URL introspection matched the target host/path/query, while
`state=page_text_available` means URL introspection was unavailable but the page
started exposing readable WebView text.

| arg | type | required | default | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `device` | str | yes | — | ADB serial or `ios:<udid>` |
| `url` | str | yes | — | Adds `https://` if no scheme is supplied. |
| `bundle_id` | str | no | configured iOS bundle | iOS override, e.g. `com.google.chrome.ios`. |

### `web_search(device, query, engine="google", bundle_id=None)`

Open a search results page in whatever browser is on the device. Faster than
`launch_app(chrome) → tap_element(address bar) → type_text → press_enter`
(four steps collapsed to one).

| arg | type | required | default | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `device` | str | yes | — | ADB serial or `ios:<udid>` |
| `query` | str | yes | — | Free-text. Don't pre-URL-encode — the tool handles it. |
| `engine` | str | no | `"google"` | One of `google`, `ddg` / `duckduckgo`, `bing`, `brave`. |
| `bundle_id` | str | no | configured iOS bundle | iOS override, e.g. `com.google.chrome.ios`. |

### Browser Readback

| tool | purpose |
|---|---|
| `browser_back(device)` | Navigate back in the active browser/app context. |
| `get_current_url(device)` | Current iOS browser URL when WebDriver/WebView exposes it. |
| `wait_for_text(device, text, timeout=12)` | Wait for visible text before continuing. |
| `extract_visible_text(device, max_lines=200)` | Return visible page text with browser controls filtered by default. iOS falls back to OCR when WebView/native text is empty. |
| `extract_articles(device, max_items=5)` | Return likely headlines/articles. iOS returns URLs when WebView extraction exposes anchors and OCR coordinates when only pixels are available. |
| `read_news(device, url="https://text.npr.org/", max_headlines=5, max_articles=3)` | iOS Chrome/WebDriver workflow that opens a news page, waits for headline/body extraction readiness, uses OCR fallback when needed, opens the first articles, and returns title/body snippets plus navigation evidence. |

`read_news` also returns an `extraction` object with headline readiness,
front-page text readiness, and per-article source evidence. The `source` fields
identify whether useful content came from WebView JavaScript, native
accessibility XML, mixed sources, or OCR, and `attempts`/line counts show
whether the workflow returned because content was ready or because the wait
deadline expired.

#### How fallback works

Android implementation in `gitd/services/web_search.py:open_search`:

1. Build the search URL: e.g. `https://www.google.com/search?q=<urlencoded>`.
2. One ADB call probes installed packages: `pm list packages` → set.
3. Walk a priority list of browsers, skipping ones that aren't installed:

   Chrome → Firefox → Samsung Internet → Edge → Brave → Opera → Opera GX → Vivaldi → DuckDuckGo Browser

4. For the first hit, fire `am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d <url> -p <pkg>`. Parse stdout for `Error:` / `no activities found` to detect failure.
5. If every priority browser failed (or none was installed), fire the same intent **without** `-p` and let Android resolve to whatever browser handles `VIEW`.
6. As a true last resort (e.g. an extreme stripped-down vendor build with zero browsers): open `market://search?q=browser&c=apps` to nudge the user to install one, and return a clear failure string the agent can show.

#### URL safety

The URL is passed to `subprocess` as a single argument (list form), so
`&` and `?` aren't interpreted by the shell. URL-encoding via
`urllib.parse.quote` covers the rest.

#### Examples

```python
web_search(device, "best gemma 4 benchmarks")            # → Chrome / Google
web_search(device, "self-hosted langfuse", engine="ddg") # → Chrome / DuckDuckGo
```

Both work through `gitd/services/browser.py` when the model is `claude-code`
(MCP) or `on-device` Gemma.

## Screen Recording

| tool | purpose |
|---|---|
| `start_screen_recording(device, filename="")` | Start a device MP4 recording. Android uses `adb shell screenrecord`; iOS records WDA MJPEG through `ffmpeg`. |
| `stop_screen_recording(device)` | Stop the active recording and return the saved MP4 URL/path. |
| `screen_recording_status(device)` | Return active recording status for the device. |
| `get_stream_info(device, mode="mjpeg", fps=5)` | Return effective stream metadata without opening the stream. iOS reports WDA MJPEG URL/settings, screenshot fallback, and unsupported Portal/WebRTC actions. |

REST equivalents are `POST /api/phone/recording/start`,
`POST /api/phone/recording/stop`, `GET /api/phone/recording/status/{device}`,
`GET /api/phone/recordings`, `GET /api/phone/recording/{filename}`, and
`GET /api/phone/stream-info`.

## Skills

Skill metadata is platform-aware. `skill.yaml` can declare:

```yaml
platforms: ["android"]          # or ["ios"], or ["android", "ios"]
app_package: com.example.app    # legacy Android package field
android_package: com.example.app
ios_bundle_id: com.google.chrome.ios
```

Legacy skills without `platforms` remain Android skills unless they declare an
`ios_bundle_id`. REST, MCP, scheduler jobs, and in-process agent tools all
reject unsupported device refs before starting the skill runner.

### `list_skills(device=None, supported_only=false)`

Returns installed skills with `platforms`, `supports_android`, `supports_ios`,
Android package, iOS bundle id, actions, workflows, `default_params`, and
`platform_limitations`. Supplying `device` adds `supported_on_device`;
`supported_only=true` filters incompatible skills for the target device. Agents
should inspect `platform_limitations` before choosing iOS smoke workflows such
as `tiktok_ios`.

### `run_skill(device, skill, workflow, params={})` / `run_workflow(...)`

Runs a workflow only when the skill supports the target platform. Android-only
skills return a stable unsupported-platform error for `ios:<udid>` instead of
being queued and failing later.

`run_workflow` is the MCP-compatible alias exposed to in-process agents and the
Tools Hub. It uses the same platform-aware skill runner as `run_skill`.

### `run_action(device, skill, action, params={})`

Runs one exported skill action through the same platform guard. Use this for
small validation steps such as an iOS browser/news action or a TikTok iOS smoke
action when a full workflow would be too broad.

### `explore_app(device, package, max_depth=2, max_states=10)`

Builds a state graph by launching the app and exploring interactive elements.
Android state identity uses the existing XML skeleton hash. iOS state identity
adds bundle/activity, normalized WDA tree hash, and screenshot hash so visually
different screens with similar accessibility trees do not collapse together.

### `create_skill(name, app_package, steps, platforms="", ios_bundle_id="", elements_ios="", elements_android="")`

Creates a recorded skill from JSON steps. Existing Android calls can keep using
`app_package`. For iOS, pass `platforms="ios"` and either `ios_bundle_id` or the
bundle id in `app_package`; optional `elements_ios` and `elements_android` JSON
maps are written to `elements_ios.yaml` and `elements.yaml`.

## Intents (escape hatch)

### `launch_intent(device, action, data, package, extras)`

Fire an arbitrary Android intent. Use when no dedicated tool fits.

```text
Open a URL:    action=android.intent.action.VIEW data=https://google.com
Open Settings: package=com.android.settings
Share text:    action=android.intent.action.SEND extras='{"android.intent.extra.TEXT": "hello"}'
```

## UI primitives

| tool | purpose |
|---|---|
| `tap(device, x, y)` | Raw coordinate tap. |
| `tap_element(device, idx)` | Tap by element index from `get_screen_tree`. Prefer this. |
| `swipe(device, direction)` | `up` / `down` / `left` / `right`. |
| `long_press(device, x, y, duration_ms=1000)` | Long-press for context menus. |
| `type_text(device, text)` | Type into the focused field. |
| `press_key(device, key)` | `BACK`, `HOME`, `ENTER`, etc. |

## Observation

| tool | purpose |
|---|---|
| `screenshot(device)` | Full PNG. Use when OCR / visual reasoning is needed. |
| `get_screen_tree(device)` | XML accessibility tree, indexed for `tap_element`. Cheaper than screenshots. |
| `get_phone_state(device)` | Foreground app, activity, keyboard state. The lightest "where am I?" probe. |
| `device_health(device)` | Comprehensive diagnostics. Android reports Portal/device subsystems; iOS reports Appium/WDA status, recommended fix, and recovery steps. |
| `fix_device_health(device, issue)` | Apply a recovery action from `device_health.recommended_fix`. iOS can start local Appium, reset WDA sessions, and restart user-owned RemoteXPC tunnels when possible. |
| `find_on_screen(device, text)` | Locate visible text via XML first, OCR fallback. |

## Notifications

| tool | purpose |
|---|---|
| `get_notifications(device)` | JSON of active notifications. Android uses dumpsys; iOS opens Notification Center and extracts visible text through WDA. |
| `open_notifications(device)` | Pull down the shade or iOS Notification Center. |
| `clear_notifications(device)` | Dismiss visible notifications when the platform exposes a clear control. |

iOS notification support is UI-driven. `get_notifications` returns visible
Notification Center text grouped into `{title, text}` records without package
identity, and `clear_notifications` only succeeds when a visible Clear/Clear All
control is present.

REST equivalents are `GET /api/phone/notifications/{device}`,
`POST /api/phone/notifications/open`, and
`POST /api/phone/notifications/clear`.

## Marketing Data

| tool | purpose |
|---|---|
| `lookup_lead(handle)` | Return the stored TikTok lead fact sheet, outreach history, and latest inbox state for one handle. |
| `list_unread_leads()` | List influencer inbox replies with unread count and latest message preview. |

These tools are device-neutral and are available to Android and iOS agent
sessions. They do not control the phone; they read Ghost's local marketing DB
so an agent can decide which mobile workflow to run next.

---

## Adding a new tool

The convention is:

1. **Implementation** in a service module under `gitd/services/`. One module per
   feature area (`web_search.py`, `device_context.py`, etc.).
2. **MCP exposure** in `gitd/mcp_server.py` — a thin `@mcp.tool()` wrapper that
   imports from the service module. Docstring is what claude-code sees.
3. **Local tool list** in `gitd/services/agent_tools.py`:
   - Add a dict to `TOOLS` (name, description, JSON-schema input).
   - Add a branch in `execute_tool` that imports from the service module and
     calls it.

Sharing the service module guarantees both paths execute the *exact same*
logic — there's no drift between "what claude does" and "what Gemma does."

## Observability

Every tool call becomes a `tool:<name>` span under the parent `chat:*` trace
in Langfuse (see `docs/OBSERVABILITY.md`). Args land as `input`, return value
as `output`, errors get `level=ERROR`. So if the agent picks the wrong tool
for a job, you'll see it in the trace timeline.
