# Framework-of-Thoughts

## Description
`framework-of-thoughts` is a Python library designed to model and optimize graph-based multi-step reasoning problems using large language models (LLMs). It provides tools for creating, visualizing and executing prompting strategies, and optimizing hyperparameters using optuna.

## Installation

To install the project, you can use `pip install git+https://github.com/fjfricke/llm-graph-optimizer.git`. Ensure you have Python 3.12 installed.

## Development

To install the project for development purposes or to run the examples, ensure you have Python 3.12 installed. Clone the project. Then, use `poetry` to set up the environment:

```bash
poetry install
```

This will install all required dependencies.

### Activating the Virtual Environment

After installing the dependencies, activate the virtual environment created by `poetry`:

```bash
poetry shell
```

## Optional Features

The project provides several optional features that can be installed using `poetry` extras. These extras enable additional functionality for specific use cases:

- **examples**: Includes dependencies needed to run the examples in the `examples` directory. If you want to replicate the studies, please also install the `optimizer` extra.
- **dataset**: Adds support to run experiments on entire datasets.
- **optimizer**: `dataset` + installs `optuna` and `optuna-dashboard` for hyperparameter optimization, as well as `dspy`.
- **dev**: Installs development tools like `ruff` and `pre-commit` for linting and code formatting if you want to contribute to the project. :)

### Installing Extras

To install an extra, use the following command:

```bash
poetry install --extras "<extra_name>"
```

For example, to install the `examples` extra:

```bash
poetry install --extras "examples"
```

### Installing All Extras

To install all extras at once, use the following command:

```bash
poetry install --all-extras
```

## Usage

Explore the `examples` directory for modelling Tree of Thoughts (ToT) and Graph of Thoughts (GoT) on the Sorting Problem, ToT on Game of 24, GoT on the Document Merging problem, and ProbTree on the HotpotQA and MuSiQue datasets.
Instructions to run the examples can be seen in the respective README files in the directory for each example.

A mock example called "test" is also provided to show how to use the library using Self-Consistency prompting on simple math problems.

A tutorial is provided under `examples/test/tutorial.ipynb` to show how to use the library for modelling and optimizing execution graphs. We recommend checking that out to get started. You can find a snapshot html version at `examples/test/tutorial_snapshot.html`.

## Features

- Modelling of graph-based prompting strategies with support for various graph operations and measurements.
- Integration with `optuna` for optimization of hyperparameters. Integration with `dspy` for optimization of prompts. Note that the latter is not fully supported and only a COPRO-style prompt optimization on a single prompt is implemented so far.
- Example scripts and datasets to reproduce the results in the paper.

## Setting the OpenAI API key

Please add an `.env` file to the root of the project with the following:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
```

Alternatively, you can also pass the api key directly to the LLM constructor.

```python
llm = OpenAIChat(api_key="your_openai_api_key", ...) or
llm_with_logprobs = OpenAIChatWithLogprobs(api_key="your_openai_api_key", ...)
```

For the development, Cursor, mainly with Openai GPT 4o, was used; mainly for code completion, repository structuring, refactoring, and error fixing.
