// Stuck-pattern detectors and run-output steers: the two ways the agent loop
// notices a turn is going nowhere and says something useful about it.
//
// Detectors — stateful, one per repetition shape:
//
//	recordToolCall  — the same (tool, args) signature repeated in close
//	                  succession: read_file('app.py') four times in six
//	                  turns, the same failing curl three times over.
//	recordReasoning — the same reasoning prefix emitted turn after turn,
//	                  the prose sibling of the above.
//
// Each keeps a rolling window on AgentContext, fires once that window crosses
// a threshold, clears the window itself, and returns the corrective the loop
// injects before the next LLM call plus a repeatObservation describing the
// streak it just erased.
//
// Steers — stateless, one per recognizable failure in command output:
//
//	missingModuleSteer      — ModuleNotFoundError. The sandbox ships no app
//	                          libraries, so the steer says install it rather
//	                          than leaving the model to re-run the command.
//	missingCommandSteer     — "git: command not found" and friends.
//	brokenInlineScriptSteer — a python -c one-liner the shell mangled.
//	missingFileSteer        — a path the OS couldn't open that differs from
//	                          a real workspace file only by case.
//	tracebackSteer          — a Python traceback, reduced to the deepest
//	                          in-project file:line:function, with
//	                          tracebackExclusion and runBlockAfterTraceback
//	                          keeping the model from re-running the same
//	                          crash before it edits.
//
// The steers are not detectors in the same sense: they hold no state, track
// no history, and read one tool result rather than a window of them. They sit
// here because they answer the same loop question from the other side —
// the detectors see the model about to repeat itself, the steers see what the
// workspace already said about why.
