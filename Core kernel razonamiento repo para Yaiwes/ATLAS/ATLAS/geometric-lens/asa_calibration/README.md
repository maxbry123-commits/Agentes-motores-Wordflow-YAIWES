# ASA steering vectors — structural_edit vs edit_file bias

May 2026 BiasBusters #4. Complements the grammar-level enforcement
(items #2/#3 in `proxy/agent.go`) by shifting the proposal distribution
upstream: even before grammar can ban `edit_file`, the residual stream
is already biased toward `structural_edit` for whole-function/class/element
swaps.

## Published vectors predate the tool rename

The tool this vector biases toward was named `ast_edit` when the currently
published vectors were built, and the contrast prompts in
`generate_pairs.py` embedded that literal string. The prompt templates now
say `structural_edit`; the published `.gguf` artifacts do not.

The artifacts keep the filename `ast_edit_steering.gguf`, because
`atlas/cli/commands/model_registry.py` pins them by name and SHA256 against
the HuggingFace dataset — renaming the file would 404 every download.

A published vector still encodes the underlying decision (replace a whole
named node vs. patch a line), which is what the contrast was built to
capture, so it does not break tool calling. It has not been re-measured
against the new tool name. To rebuild against the current prompts, per
model:

```
# regenerates contrast_pairs.jsonl from the current templates, then
# extracts residuals in the lens container
atlas asa build <registry-model-name>
atlas asa check
atlas asa publish <registry-model-name>
```

`asa build` regenerates `contrast_pairs.jsonl` on demand when `--pairs` is
omitted, so it picks up the renamed templates in `generate_pairs.py` with no
extra step. After publishing, update the pinned SHA256 in
`model_registry.py`.

This is independent of the Geometric Lens retrain, which is the one that
consumes `atlas bench` results.

```

## Steps

1. **Curate contrast pairs** in `contrast_pairs.jsonl`. Generate 1000 pairs
   with `generate_pairs.py` from
   richly-templated base scenarios (Python functions / decorated
   functions / async / generators / classes / dataclasses; HTML body /
   head / header / nav / main / footer / form / aside / section /
   article; post-write_file-rejection variants). Each pair is one
   `structural_edit` correct example and one `edit_file` incorrect example
   for the **same** user task; positional order matters
   (cvector-generator contrasts line N of positive vs line N of
   negative). To regenerate with a different seed, n, or extended
   pools:
   ```
   python generate_pairs.py --out contrast_pairs.jsonl --n 1000 --seed 42
   ```
   Add new templates or variation pools at the top of `generate_pairs.py`
   to expand coverage; rerun and the cvector vector picks up the new
   diversity on the next extraction.

2. **Build prompt files**:
   ```bash
   python build_cvector_prompts.py \
     --pairs contrast_pairs.jsonl \
     --positive structural_edit_positive.txt \
     --negative structural_edit_negative.txt
   ```
   The script calls the loaded llama-server's `/apply-template` endpoint, so
   the prompts use the selected model's own chat template rather than tokens
   from a hard-coded model family.

3. **Generate the control vector** (requires `llama-cvector-generator`
   binary built from `/tmp/llama.cpp/tools/cvector-generator/`):
   ```bash
   llama-cvector-generator \
     -m /models/your-model.gguf \
     --positive-file structural_edit_positive.txt \
     --negative-file structural_edit_negative.txt \
     --method mean \
     -o ast_edit_steering.gguf \
     -ngl 99
   ```
   `--method mean` is the simple mean-difference variant (matches the
   ASA paper's v_global = μ(pos) − μ(neg)). `--method pca` is the
   principal-component variant; better signal but needs more pairs to
   be stable.

4. **Drop the vector and its model marker at the standard path** (`atlas asa
   build` writes both automatically):
   ```
   /models/ast_edit_steering.gguf
   /models/ast_edit_steering.gguf.model
   ```
   `inference/entrypoint-v3.1.sh` checks for this file at every
   start and appends `--control-vector-scaled` only when the marker identifies
   the selected model. A vector left behind after a model switch is disabled
   rather than silently applied in the wrong residual space.

   To override the path, scale, or layer range:
   - `ATLAS_CONTROL_VECTOR=/some/other/path.gguf` (default `/models/ast_edit_steering.gguf`)
   - `ATLAS_CONTROL_VECTOR_SCALE=1.0` (default `0.5` — conservative; bump to 1.0–1.5 if behavior change is too subtle, drop toward 0.2 if other tasks degrade)
   - `ATLAS_CONTROL_VECTOR_LAYER_RANGE="24 30"` (default: all layers)

5. **Validate** by re-running the May 7 flask-app test that surfaced
   the bias. Expected outcome: model proposes `structural_edit` on first
   attempt for whole-function rewrites, without needing the grammar
   trigger to fire.

## Layer scope (optional)

By default `--control-vector-scaled` applies the steering to all
layers. The ASA practitioner's guide recommends ~75% of the selected model's
depth. `atlas asa build` derives that layer from llama-server metadata. If you
want to scope the runtime application:

```
--control-vector-scaled FILE:SCALE \
--control-vector-layer-range 24 30
```

Narrower ranges are safer (less collateral damage to non-tool tasks)
but the signal is weaker.

## Why not always-on?

ASA composes with the grammar gate (items #2/#3) — the grammar is a
hard ban that fires after a write_file rejection on .py/.html. ASA
covers the cases the grammar gate doesn't: **first-attempt** decisions
where no rejection has happened yet. Both can run together; they don't
conflict.

The gating decision lives at the entrypoint (env var present ⇒ on,
absent ⇒ off). No proxy changes are needed beyond the startup log
that surfaces the configured state.
