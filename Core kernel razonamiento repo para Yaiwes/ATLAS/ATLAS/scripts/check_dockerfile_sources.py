"""Fail when a Dockerfile COPY names a source path that does not exist.

A COPY whose source was deleted is invisible to every other check: the tree
imports cleanly, tests pass, lint passes, and the failure only appears when
someone builds the image. It bit twice in one cleanup — geometric-lens
COPY'd `indexer/` and `retriever/` after the retrieval stack was removed, and
v3-service COPY'd `wavelet/` and `rpg.py` after the planner was removed. The
second one reached CI, where `tests` was green and only the image job failed.

Each Dockerfile is checked against its build context as declared in
docker-compose.yml, because the context determines what a relative source
resolves against: v3-service builds from the repo root, so its sources read
`v3-service/main.py`, while geometric-lens builds from its own directory and
its sources read `main.py`. Getting that wrong in either direction produces
false results, so contexts are read from compose rather than guessed.

Sources containing a glob or a build-arg substitution are skipped — they
cannot be resolved statically. `--from=` COPYs are skipped too: those name a
path inside an earlier build stage, not the context.

Usage: check_dockerfile_sources.py
