## 📖 OpenRSI

OpenRSI is Frontis's open initiative for turning “AI improving AI” into an executable engineering problem. It develops AI4AI systems through three connected routes:

- **AI4AI foundation models** that internalize reusable research processes
- **World models and research taste** that identify where additional compute is worth spending
- **Open tasks, environments, and evaluations** that convert real research into scalable training and search pipelines

Search produces experience, experience enters training, and trained models return to search and evaluation. The goal is not a one-off benchmark result, but to make each generation of AI R&D **faster, more efficient, and more capable** in ways that are verifiable and attributable.

> **OpenRSI makes the rate of improvement itself an optimization target.**

The mechanism ladder moves from **Evolution** to **Self-Evolution**, **Meta-Evolution**, and ultimately RSI. OpenRSI begins with Meta-Evolution—training the improver itself in bounded, executable domains—without claiming that general recursive self-improvement has been solved.

## 🚀 Frontis-MA1: The First OpenRSI Release

Our first executable domain is **machine learning engineering (MLE)**. MLE provides a concrete setting in which an AI system can draft, improve, debug, and recombine programs; execute them; observe measurable feedback; and learn from the resulting trajectories.

**[Frontis-MA1: Training an AI4AI Model towards Recursive Self-Improvement in Machine Learning Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.28568)**

<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>

Recursive self-improvement (RSI) requires AI systems that improve the process of building AI (i.e., AI4AI); machine learning engineering (MLE) offers a concrete, executable testbed for studying this capability.

We introduce OpenMLE, an open full-stack system for RSI research in MLE, spanning verifiable task environments with execution feedback (OpenMLE-Gym), operator learning (OpenMLE-RL), and long-horizon search (OpenMLE-Evo). On this stack we post-train Frontis-MA1 (35B) as a meta-evolution agent for MLE, aligning post-training and inference around four atomic program-evolution operators (Draft, Improve, Debug, Crossover): the same operators are trained via execution-grounded SFT and RL on data deduplicated against all evaluation benchmarks, then composed into long-horizon search, coupling learning and evolution in a single loop.

On MLE-Bench Lite under a 12-hour per-task budget on one RTX 4090 capped at 12 GB VRAM, Frontis-MA1 (35B) improves Medal Average from 39.39% to 60.61% over its base model with OpenMLE-Evo, and reaches 71.21% with OpenMLE-Evo-Max (benchmark-independent experience priors and asynchronous search), exceeding GPT-5.5 + Codex and approaching GPT-5.6 Sol and the 2.8T Kimi K3.

On held-out NatureBench Lite, both components transfer: with the framework fixed, swapping in the trained model raises Match-SOTA from 50% to 70%; with the model fixed, swapping in OpenMLE-Evo raises it from 20% to 50%.

We release the model weights and the full OpenMLE stack to enable reproducible research on executable AI4AI toward RSI.

## 🧩 OpenMLE: The Executable Stack

OpenMLE aligns post-training and inference around a shared action space. The same program-evolution operators are learned from execution-grounded data and composed into long-horizon search.

| Component | Role | Entry point |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **OpenMLE-Gym** | Build, describe, execute, and quality-check verifiable MLE task packages | [`OpenMLE-Gym/`](OpenMLE-Gym/) |
| **OpenMLE-RL** | Learn program-evolution operators through execution-grounded SFT and online RL | [`OpenMLE-ERL/SFT/`](OpenMLE-ERL/SFT/) · [`OpenMLE-ERL/RL/`](OpenMLE-ERL/RL/) |
| **Frontis-MA1** | Apply the learned operators as a meta-evolution agent for MLE | [35B](https://huggingface.co/FrontisAI/Frontis-MA1-35B) · [30B](https://huggingface.co/FrontisAI/Frontis-MA1-30B) |
| **OpenMLE-Evo** | Compose the operators into standard or asynchronous long-horizon search | [`OpenMLE-Evo/`](OpenMLE-Evo/) |

OpenMLE-Evo-Max is the asynchronous multi-GPU search profile inside `OpenMLE-Evo`, not a separate source tree. OpenMLE-RL ships in the [`OpenMLE-ERL/`](OpenMLE-ERL/) directory, which bundles both of its stages: execution-grounded SFT and online RL.

Distributed code execution and automatic evaluation for OpenMLE-Evo and OpenMLE-ERL are provided by [OpenMLE Sandbox](OpenMLE-Gym/openmle-sandbox/README.md), which is maintained as part of OpenMLE-Gym.

### Trainable Atomic Operators

| Operator | Function |
| --- | --- |
| **Draft** | Generate a program from scratch. |
| **Improve** | Refine a parent program using execution feedback. |
| **Debug** | Repair a failing program. |
| **Crossover** | Recombine two parent programs. |

## 📊 Results

On MLE-Bench Lite, Frontis-MA1 and OpenMLE separate model improvement from search-system improvement through controlled comparisons:

| Finding | Controlled comparison | Result |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| **Post-training gain** | Base model → Frontis-MA1-35B, OpenMLE-Evo fixed | **39.39% → 60.61%** Medal Average |
| **End-to-end system** | Frontis-MA1-35B + OpenMLE-Evo-Max | **71.21%** Medal Average |
| **Held-out model transfer** | Model swapped, NatureBench adapter fixed | **50% → 70%** Match-SOTA |
| **Held-out framework transfer** | Framework swapped, base model fixed | **20% → 50%** Match-SOTA |

These are **model–harness results**, not standalone one-shot model scores. The OpenMLE-Evo-Max result changes the search system through benchmark-independent experience priors and asynchronous search, and should not be interpreted as a pure model gain.

## ✨ Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FrontisAI/OpenRSI.git
cd OpenRSI
```

OpenRSI contains several independently runnable stages rather than one synthetic top-level command. Each component manages its own environment and dependencies — start from the one that matches your goal:

| Goal | Start here |
| --- | --- |
| Construct or evaluate executable task packages | [`OpenMLE-Gym/README.md`](OpenMLE-Gym/README.md) |
| Generate or select SFT data and launch supervised training | [`OpenMLE-ERL/SFT/README.md`](OpenMLE-ERL/SFT/README.md) |
| Configure and launch execution-grounded RL | [`OpenMLE-ERL/RL/README.md`](OpenMLE-ERL/RL/README.md) |
| Run OpenMLE-Evo or a benchmark adapter | [`OpenMLE-Evo/README.md`](OpenMLE-Evo/README.md) |

### Quick Start: Run One NatureBench Case Locally

Run a real OpenMLE-Evo search and evaluation loop on
`s42256-023-00611-x` (Categorical Counterfactual Outcome Estimation). The
following smoke profile generates and evaluates one candidate; task data,
generated code, and evaluation stay on the local machine.

```bash
# Continue from the Getting Started commands above.
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/FrontisAI/NatureBench.git
cd OpenRSI/OpenMLE-Evo

python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
conda env create -f environments/naturebench-local.yml

export PRIMARY_KEY='your-api-key'
.venv/bin/python scripts/run_naturebench_local.py \
  --naturebench-repo ../../NatureBench \
  --conda-env naturebench-local \
  --model-base-url https://model.example/v1 \
  --model-id served-model-name \
  --smoke
```

The same runner also supports local or remote SGLang endpoints. Remove
`--smoke` for the full single-task search profile. See the
[local NatureBench tutorial](OpenMLE-Evo/benchmarks/naturebench_local_quick/README.md)
for SGLang commands, the four-hour search budget, advanced overrides, and the
local-execution security boundary, then read the
[example trajectory analysis](OpenMLE-Evo/benchmarks/naturebench_local_quick/RESULTS.md)
for score attribution and optimization dynamics.

Model weights, task artifacts, training corpora, external benchmark environments, service credentials, and private infrastructure configuration are distributed separately from this source repository.
