/**
 * Regression: issue #121 — `bootstrap.ts` kept a `TraceRecorder` per session
 * id in a Map that had no `delete`/`clear` anywhere, so a long-lived runtime
 * serving many sessions (sidecar, HTTP server, background tasks) grew it
 * forever. The map is now bounded, evicts least-recently-*used* first, and
 * never evicts a session with a turn in flight.
 *
 * `recorders` is a closure-private detail of `createAgentRuntime`, so this
 * mirrors the three helpers it uses (`touchRecorder`, `dropRecorder`,
 * `evictRecorders`) and pins the rules they implement. An earlier version of
 * this file re-implemented plain insertion-order eviction and so agreed with
 * the bug it was meant to catch: `Map` preserves insertion order, which is
 * not recency, so the oldest-*created* session was evicted even while it was
 * the one actively running.
