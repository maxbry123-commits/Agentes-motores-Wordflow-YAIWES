/**
 * Resource class taxonomy for parallel batched tool calls.
 *
 * The batch executor groups calls by `ResourceClass`:
 *  - `pure_read`     — parallel-safe; no shared mutable state. Runs as
 *                      `Promise.allSettled`.
 *  - `fs_write`      — file-system writes. Serialised within its group
 *                      to keep behaviour deterministic when the model
 *                      writes multiple files in one batch. (Note: most
 *                      fs_write verbs also require approval, so they
 *                      additionally land in `approval_gated` and are
 *                      forbidden inside a batch entirely.)
 *  - `browser`       — Playwright is a single-process resource. All
 *                      `browser.*` calls serialise within their group.
 *  - `memory_write`  — `ProfileStore` / `MemoryStore` writes. Serialised
 *                      to keep observation order predictable, even
 *                      though `better-sqlite3` is synchronous.
 *  - `tasks_write`   — Task store mutations. Same rationale.
 *  - `vision`        — `vision.describe` issues HTTP calls to a separate
 *                      llama-server slot; serialised to bound concurrent
 *                      vision load on the backend.
 *  - `approval_gated`— Virtual class. Tools that may invoke
 *                      `requireApproval` synchronously inside `run()`.
 *                      Forbidden inside a batch — the validator rejects
 *                      the parse and the model is asked to split.
 *  - `terminal`      — `reply` / `finish`. Allowed only as the LAST
 *                      element of a multi-call batch; mid-batch or
 *                      duplicated terminals are rejected. The executor
 *                      runs the terminal call strictly after every
 *                      non-terminal call has settled, so `[store, reply]`
 *                      collapses into one inference whose transcript is
 *                      `tool_call(store) → tool_result(store) →
 *                      assistant_reply`. Solo terminal calls keep the
 *                      legacy semantics (length-1 batch).
 *
 * Groups in distinct classes execute concurrently with each other; the
 * total step wall is `max(group durations)`.
 *
 * Tools not listed here default to `unknown`, which the validator
 * rejects from any batch (fail-closed). When you add a new tool, add
 * its name here too — the test in `tool-resource-class.test.ts`
 * asserts that every entry in `DEFAULT_TOOL_DESCRIPTORS` has an
 * explicit class.
