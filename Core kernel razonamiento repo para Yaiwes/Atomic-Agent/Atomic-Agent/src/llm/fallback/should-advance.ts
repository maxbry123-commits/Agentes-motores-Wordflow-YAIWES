/**
 * Map a thrown value onto the fallover decision using the canonical
 * reliability taxonomy plus the typed HTTP status where available.
 *
 * Category rules (see `src/llm/reliability/`):
 *  - `transport` → advance (provider unreachable). Note every cloud
 *    `OpenAiHttpError` classifies as `transport` regardless of status, so
 *    a 404 model-not-found or a 401 dead key advances too — a different
 *    link may have the model or a working key. Untyped socket failures
 *    (undici's `TypeError: fetch failed` and friends, from surfaces that
 *    do not wrap their own errors) land here too — see `isNetworkError`.
 *  - `model` → advance. This is a *defective completion* from a reachable
 *    provider (truncated / empty / no_stop), not "model not found"; the
 *    same prompt would reproduce it here, so another link is worth a try.
 *  - `grammar` / `tool` / `cancelled` → do not advance. A grammar/4xx
 *    failure is request-shape and repeats identically on every provider;
 *    a tool failure is our own bug; a cancellation is user intent.
 *
 * Immediate signals are read off the typed status carried by
 * `OpenAiHttpError` / `LlamaServerError` / `TransportError`: an explicit
 * 429/408, any 5xx, or a network-level null status that is not our own
 * request timeout (`timedOut` — one slow provider is weaker evidence and
 * only counts toward the threshold).
