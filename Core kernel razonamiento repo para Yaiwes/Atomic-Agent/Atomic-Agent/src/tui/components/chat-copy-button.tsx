/**
 * The per-message copy affordance in the chat log.
 *
 * **Why a button at all.** Mouse reporting takes the terminal's own
 * drag-to-select away (see `mouse-tracking.ts`), and "I want that reply
 * on my clipboard" is overwhelmingly the reason anyone selects text in a
 * chat TUI. A button answers that intent directly and, unlike a
 * selection, copies the message *source* — the raw text, not the
 * markdown-rendered, border-decorated, hard-wrapped thing on screen,
 * which is what a drag would have given you.
 *
 * **Why brackets and no colour.** `[copy]` in the palette's `muted`
 * grey, dimmed, is the quietest thing that still reads as a control.
 * There is one of these under every message; anything with hue would
 * turn the transcript into a column of badges. "Dark grey" is expressed
 * as a theme token rather than a literal because the four light palettes
 * would swallow a literal `#555` whole — `muted` + `dimColor` is the
 * darkest grey each palette actually has.
 *
 * **Without a mouse provider** (component tests, `--no-mouse`) the
 * button still renders — it is a legible hint that the message has a
 * copy affordance when the mouse is on — but registers no target.
