 * (3). Counted off the rendered component and pinned by the

 *

 * that is a *budget* and errs one row generous on purpose (the same

/**
 * Floats the composer over the content pane, bottom-anchored.
 *
 * The house overlay technique is `menu-popup.tsx`'s: absolute
 * positioning inside a relative pane, opaque because terminals have no
 * compositing. Two deltas from the menu:
 *
 * - Anchoring is by inset (`bottom/left/right: 0`), not by a computed
 *   `marginTop`: Yoga resolves the insets against the parent's final
 *   size, so the box hugs the stage's bottom edge and grows *upward*
 *   with its content — no measurement pass, no height arithmetic that
 *   a wrapped meta-row could put off by one.
 * - Opacity comes from `PromptShell`'s own frame: Ink 7 paints a box's
 *   `backgroundColor` across its full interior (`render-background.js`
 *   fills every row with spaces), so the frame occludes edge to edge
 *   without per-line padding. The one see-through row is the spacer
 *   above the frame (the top margin the shell used to carry), which is
 *   meant to show the content behind.
 *
 * The mouse backstop is the popup-frame pattern: a box claims every
 * press at `MOUSE_LAYER_PANEL`, so a click on composer pixels can never
 * fall through to the chat controls painted beneath. The backstop
 * hugs the *frame*, not the whole overlay: the see-through spacer row
 * shows live content, so a control painted there must keep receiving
 * its clicks — which is why the spacer is a sibling row outside the
 * backstop box rather than a margin inside it (a child's margin counts
 * into the parent's rectangle).
 * The composer's own targets (editor body, Send, the context chip)
 * register on the same layer as smaller boxes, so the registry offers
 * them the press first. Wheel is declined on purpose — the whole-app
 * wheel target at the base layer owns transcript scrolling, exactly as
 * it did when the composer sat in the flex column.
