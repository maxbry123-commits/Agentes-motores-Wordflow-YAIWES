 * The composer's context readout: how full the model's window is, drawn

 *
 * **What the gauge measures.** The transcript against the ceiling it is
 * packed to, not the prompt against the model's window. The window is
 * the wrong scale for a bar: a 1M-token model sits at 1% all session and
 * the gauge never says anything. The transcript's cap is the number that
 * moves, and reaching it is precisely when `packConversation` starts
 * dropping the oldest turns — so the bar filling up *is* the warning.
 *
 * It is also the only scale that always exists. The window is unknown on
 * any cloud model nobody has published a context length for;
 * `conversationCapEffective` is on every built prompt, falling back to
 * the configured cap when there is no window to clamp against.
 *
 * Both numbers are printed beside the bar. Nothing here is measured
 * against a scale the operator cannot see.
 *
 * **Why the colour ramp.** Three steps of the palette's own accent, then
 * violet once the transcript has been trimmed. Violet rather than a warn
 * colour on purpose: trimming is the design working, not a fault, and
 * `warn` would send an operator looking for the error that is not there.
 * It is also the only signal for that state — no counter, no glyph. The
 * detail view says how many turns went.
 *
 * **Why occupancy and not spend.** Context here is not monotonic: it
 * falls when the packer trims and when the memory fabric lifts facts out
 * of the transcript. A cumulative token counter would climb past 100%
 * and answer a question nobody asked.
 *
 * Clicking it opens the breakdown — see `context-panel.tsx`. That is
 * what makes the button ground honest rather than decorative.
