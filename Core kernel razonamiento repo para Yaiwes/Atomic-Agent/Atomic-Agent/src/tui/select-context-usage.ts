 *    `localModels.mode: "managed"` *defers* the boot probe, so a local
 *    turn can build its prompt with no window while the poller already
 *    has one.
 * 3. The active cloud provider's catalogue. Read here, at render time,
 *    rather than resolved once into a `ProviderRow`: the live catalogue
 *    arrives from an async fetch at start-up, so anything baked into a
 *    row before it lands freezes a `null` that never recovers. The
 *    lookup prefers live entries over the bundled snapshot, which is the
 *    difference between knowing and not knowing for every model added
 *    since the snapshot was cut.
 * 4. Nothing. `resolveModel`'s nominal 128k default is deliberately not
 *    consulted — a gauge drawn against a guessed scale is a fabrication,
 *    and the panel says "window unknown" instead.
