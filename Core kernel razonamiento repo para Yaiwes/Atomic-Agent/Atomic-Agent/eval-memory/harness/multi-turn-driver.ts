/**
 * Drive `atomic-agent run` through N consecutive user turns and
 * read the resulting trace file to extract per-turn metrics.
 *
 * Why we go through the CLI rather than constructing `AgentRuntime`
 * in-process:
 *
 *  - The CLI is the single entrypoint the agent ships with. Driving
 *    through it exercises real stdin/stdout/trace plumbing, including
 *    config bootstrap, slot reservation, reflection scheduling.
 *  - Spawning a fresh subprocess per scenario keeps `stateDir`
 *    isolation honest — there is zero risk of an in-memory singleton
 *    leaking state between ON and OFF runs.
 *
 * The chat loop in `src/cli/run-agent.ts` reads stdin line-by-line via
 * `readline`. We **cannot** pipe all turns up-front and close stdin
 * immediately — Node's readline raises `close` as soon as it sees
 * EOF, and the second `rl.question(...)` resolves to `null` before
 * the buffered second line is delivered. Result: only the first turn
 * fires, the rest are silently dropped.
 *
 * The driver therefore advances **one prompt at a time**: it sends
 * prompt N, waits for the corresponding `assistant_reply` line on
 * stdout (the agent writes exactly one `process.stdout.write(reply +
 * "\n")` per turn), then sends prompt N+1. After the last reply, we
 * close stdin so the agent's readline loop exits cleanly.
 *
 * Per-turn data (final reply, step count, tools, tokens) is then read
 * from the trace ndjson file at
 * `<stateDir>/traces/<sessionId>.ndjson` — that file is the canonical
 * source of truth for what actually happened during each turn. We do
 * not parse the stdout reply directly; stdout is only used as a
 * **synchronisation signal** between user turns.
