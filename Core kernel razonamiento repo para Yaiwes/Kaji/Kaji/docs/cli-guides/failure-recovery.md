# Failure Triage / Recovery CLI

Language: English | [日本語](failure-recovery.ja.md)

CLI reference for the failure triage and auto recovery layer (Issue #288). It applies to both
`provider.type = "github"` and `provider.type = "local"`; the triage comment is posted through the
active provider.

For the operational rules (what is and is not resumable, why the wait exists), see
[Workflow guide](../dev/workflow_guide.md) § failure triage と自動再開. For the config keys, see
[Configuration reference](../reference/configuration.md) § `[execution]`.

## What runs when

`kaji run` classifies the failure and records evidence when the workflow process ends with `ERROR`,
or with an `ABORT` that is eligible for triage. Failures that happen **before the run directory is
created** (config discovery, workflow validation, `IssueContext` resolution) are not triaged: there
is no artifact to reason about, and an evidence-free Issue comment is worse than none.

Two layers exist and do not overlap:

| Layer | Scope | Timescale | Where |
|-------|-------|-----------|-------|
| attempt retry | transient CLI failure inside one step dispatch | seconds to minutes, in-process | `execute_cli()` |
| run recovery | `ERROR` / triage-eligible `ABORT` at the end of the workflow process | fixed 10-minute wait, then a new `kaji run` | this document |

### Interactive terminal: transient provider errors buried in the transcript (Issue #296)

When `agent_runner = "interactive_terminal"` and a tmux pane dies before writing
`verdict.yaml`, kaji scans the **entire** `terminal.log` transcript (not just the last 2000
characters) for a known transient pattern (`"at capacity"`, `"rate limit"`, `"overloaded"`, …
— the same list `execute_cli()` uses). TUI redraw can bury a one-line provider error deep in a
transcript far larger than the old tail window, so a full-transcript scan is required to avoid
misclassifying a transient capacity error as non-recoverable.

Only the matched pattern **literal** is placed in `CLIExecutionError` / `result.json.error`
(e.g. `"...transient provider error detected (pattern: 'at capacity')"`) — never a transcript
substring. This keeps unrelated text on the same physical line (such as a `Token usage:`
telemetry line) out of the classifier/sensitive-gate input, so it cannot accidentally trip the
credential-leak gate. The full ANSI-stripped excerpt and tail are kept for humans only, in
`pane-metadata.json`'s `terminal_diagnostic` key (`kind`: `provider_error` / `no_pattern` /
`no_log` / `empty`), which the classifier never reads.

The resulting `dispatch_failure` classification and `--auto-recover` behavior (candidate →
resume after 10 minutes, or `comment_only` when auto recovery is off) follow the same rules as
any other transient dispatch failure described below.

### Verdict YAML forbidden control characters no longer trigger re-execution (Issue #298)

Previously, a raw control character outside the YAML 1.2 printable range (e.g. ESC / `U+001B`)
inside a `verdict.yaml` evidence/reason field made `_parse_yaml_fields` raise `VerdictParseError`,
even when the step's external side effects (commit, push, comment) had already completed. The
runner converted this into a `verdict_exception` failure event and a synthetic `ABORT`, and
recovery classified it as `verdict_resolution_failure` — presenting the same, already-completed
step as the resume point.

`_parse_yaml_fields` now sanitizes YAML-forbidden control characters (replacing them with
`U+FFFD`) before parsing, so the artifact's real verdict resolves normally and this failure mode
no longer reaches recovery at all. TAB / LF / CR and other characters YAML permits are left
untouched. Sanitized codepoints and their position are recorded in `run.log` as a
`verdict_sanitization` event (see [logging reference](../reference/python/logging.md) §
`verdict_sanitization`) — never the raw control character itself. Verdict resolution failures
unrelated to control characters (e.g. a missing `status` field) still raise `VerdictParseError`
and are classified as `verdict_resolution_failure` exactly as before.

## `kaji run` options

| flag | Default | Meaning |
|------|---------|---------|
| `--failure-triage` / `--no-failure-triage` | config (`true`) | Classify the failure, post the triage comment, write `recovery.json` / `run.log`, print the stderr summary |
| `--auto-recover` / `--no-auto-recover` | config (`false`) | Start one child run per recovery chain when the decision is `resume` |
| `--recovery-root <run_id>` | — | Root run_id of the recovery chain (normally added by the handler) |
| `--recovery-parent <run_id>` | — | Direct parent run_id. Requires `--recovery-root`; alone it exits `2` |

Precedence matches `--agent-runner`: CLI flag > `.kaji/config.local.toml` > `.kaji/config.toml`.
`--no-failure-triage` also forces `auto_recover` off, because the handler that would start the child
run never executes.

```bash
# 1. Normal operation: triage on, auto recovery off (defaults)
kaji run .kaji/wf/official/dev.yaml 288
# → on ERROR: triage comment on the Issue, recovery.json saved, summary on stderr. exit 3

# 2. Opt in to auto recovery
kaji run .kaji/wf/official/dev.yaml 288 --auto-recover
# → decision: resume starts a child run after 10 minutes. The parent's exit code is the child's

# 3. The command the handler itself runs (you normally do not type this)
kaji run .kaji/wf/official/dev.yaml 288 --from review-code \
  --recovery-root 260710120000 --recovery-parent 260710120000
```

## `kaji recover`

Runs the same handler against an already-failed run's artifacts. Use it to investigate, to re-render
the triage report after a provider outage, or to opt into a resume after the fact.

```
kaji recover <workflow.yaml> <issue> [--run-id <run_id>] [--auto-recover] [--workdir <dir>]
```

- `--run-id` defaults to the newest run under `<artifacts_dir>/<issue>/runs/`.
- If the target run has no `workflow_end` event, `kaji recover` refuses with `2`. This prevents
  interfering with a run that is still executing.
- If the target run ended with a status other than `ERROR` / `ABORT`, it also exits `2`.
- `<workflow.yaml>` is used to resolve the resume point and to build the resume command; pointing at
  a different workflow than the one the run used is the operator's responsibility (the workflow path
  is recorded in `recovery.json`).
- Re-running it against a run that already performed an auto recovery yields `decision: exhausted`.
  The budget is one resume per recovery chain; `recovery.json` and the child run directory are the
  inputs to that decision.
- For runs produced **before** this feature (their `run.log` `workflow_start` carries no
  `schema_version`), a missing `failure_event` is not treated as a harness contradiction, so no bug
  issue is filed.

```bash
kaji recover .kaji/wf/official/dev.yaml 288
kaji recover .kaji/wf/official/dev.yaml 288 --run-id 260710120000
```

## Exit codes

The existing map (`0 = OK`, `1 = ABORT`, `2 = definition error`, `3 = runtime error`) is unchanged.

| Situation | Exit code |
|-----------|-----------|
| `kaji run` with triage only (no child run) | the original failure's exit code |
| `kaji run` that started a child run | the child's exit code (the chain's final result) |
| `kaji recover`, triage completed (any decision) | `0` |
| `kaji recover`, run not found / still in progress / flag mismatch / `requires_provider` mismatch | `2` |
| `kaji recover`, handler internal error | `3` |

## Artifacts

| Path | Content |
|------|---------|
| `runs/<run_id>/recovery.json` | `RecoveryDecision` (`schema_version: 1`), overwritten on every decision update. Carries `incident_suppressed` / `incident_suppression_reason` when incident recording was skipped (Issue #322) |
| `runs/<run_id>/recovery-chain.json` | `{root_run_id, parent_run_id}`, written by a recovery child run at startup |
| `runs/<run_id>/run.log` | `failure_event`, `recovery_decision`, `recovery_scheduled`, `recovery_attempt_start`, `recovery_attempt_end`, `incident_recorded`, `incident_recording_failed`, `incident_suppressed` |
| `incidents/occurrences.jsonl` | Local occurrence log of the incident layer (directly under `<artifacts_dir>`, append-only). One line per failure for every provider, **except for the exempted causes below** |
| Issue comment | Machine-generated triage report (posted before the child launch) plus a follow-up result comment when an auto recovery ran. No kaji-verdict marker (it is not a step verdict) |
| stderr | A short `--- failure triage ---` summary printed after the existing terminal message |

The `comment:` line of the stderr summary shows `Comment.ref`: the created comment URL for the
GitHub provider, the repo-root-relative comment file path for the local provider, and `n/a` when the
reference could not be captured.

### Incident recording exemption (Issue #322 / #403 / #405)

Failures classified as `user_precondition_error`, `user_interrupted`, `agent_declared_abort`, or
`cycle_exhausted` never enter the incident layer: no incident Issue is opened, no occurrence
comment is posted, and nothing is appended to `incidents/occurrences.jsonl`. These are known
user-originated endings that need no investigation, or contractually normal terminations, and
promoting them to incidents would drown out the real failure signal.

| Cause | Case | Decision input |
|---|---|---|
| `user_precondition_error` | The interactive terminal runner was started outside its selected backend session (`TmuxSessionRequiredError` / `HerdrSessionRequiredError`) | `failure_event.exception_type` |
| `user_interrupted` | The operator interrupted `kaji run` with Ctrl-C | `failure_event.kind == "interrupted"` |
| `agent_declared_abort` | The agent returned a legitimate ABORT verdict (safe stop / manual confirmation requested) | `failure_event.kind == "agent_abort"` |
| `cycle_exhausted` | A cycle reached `max_iterations` (safety valve worked as designed) | `failure_event.kind == "cycle_exhausted"` |

All four decisions key off the structured `failure_event` recorded in `run.log`, never off the raw
error message. A missing backend binary, an insufficient backend version, and every other
`CLINotFoundError` keep their existing incident recording behavior.

`agent_declared_abort` and `cycle_exhausted` end without an exception, so the identity signature's
canonical input is always empty and the fingerprint degenerates to a per-cause constant. `cause` is
itself part of the match key, so the two causes never collapse into each other. Without this
exemption, unrelated safe stops that share a cause — regardless of their step or actual stop
reason — would all collapse into a single incident Issue per cause (Issue #405).

An interrupted run ends with `workflow_end status=ERROR`, so `kaji recover` can select it as a triage
target (`user_interrupted` maps to the `comment_only` decision; it is never auto-resumed). The
interruption is recorded at run level only — no `result.json` is written for the in-flight attempt.
The interactive terminal runner leaves the agent pane alive and surfaces its `pane_id` in the triage
evidence (see the [interactive terminal runner guide](./interactive-terminal-runner.md) § session
continuation). Only an in-flight attempt — one without a `result.json` — contributes orphan pane
evidence; a completed attempt's pane has already been cleaned up. Without that distinction an
interruption that lands before the next attempt directory exists would report the previous,
already-killed pane as an orphan.

Even when incident recording is suppressed, the console error, the run artifacts, and the triage
comment on the originating Issue are all preserved. The suppression itself is auditable from the
`incident_suppressed` event in `run.log` (`cause` / `exception_type` / `failed_step` / `reason`) and
from the two `recovery.json` fields above.
