"""NVIDIA OO Agents CLI — extensible command-line toolkit.

Usage:
    nooa eval --config config.yaml  # Run an eval-pipeline job
    nooa start-dev                  # Start the viewer
    nooa traces delete              # Delete traces
    nooa completion install         # Set up shell completions

Adding new commands:
    In this package: drop a .py file in nooa_cli/commands/ — see
    commands/_template.py
    From another package: register an entry point in the
    "nooa_cli.commands" group — see nooa_cli/commands/__init__.py

Shell completion:
    eval "$(_NOOA_COMPLETE=bash_source nooa)"    # bash
    eval "$(_NOOA_COMPLETE=zsh_source nooa)"     # zsh
