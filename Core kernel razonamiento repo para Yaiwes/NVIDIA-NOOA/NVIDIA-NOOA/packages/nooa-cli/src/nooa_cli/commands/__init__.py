Convention
----------

Each Python file in this directory that does NOT start with ``_`` is
auto-discovered and registered as a top-level subcommand of ``nooa``.

A command module **must** export a module-level variable named ``command``
that is a ``click.BaseCommand`` (either a ``@click.command()`` or a
``@click.group()``).

Optionally, you can set:
    NAME = "custom-name"      # Override the command name (default: filename)

The file name (minus ``.py``) becomes the subcommand name by default::

    commands/start_dev.py →  nooa start-dev ...

Files starting with ``_`` are ignored (private helpers, templates, etc.).

Minimal example (commands/hello.py)::

    import click

    @click.command()
    @click.argument("name", default="world")
    def command(name):
        \"\"\"Say hello.\"\"\"
        click.echo(f"Hello, {name}!")

Full example with a group (commands/things.py)::

    import click

    @click.group()
    def command():
        \"\"\"Manage things.\"\"\"

    @command.command()
    def list():
        \"\"\"List all things.\"\"\"
        click.echo("thing-1\\nthing-2")

    @command.command()
    @click.argument("name")
    def create(name):
        \"\"\"Create a new thing.\"\"\"
        click.echo(f"Created {name}")

Commands from other packages
----------------------------

A package installed alongside ``nooa-cli`` can contribute top-level
subcommands through the ``nooa_cli.commands`` entry-point group. The
entry-point name is the subcommand name; the object it points at must be a
``click.Command``::

    # pyproject.toml of the contributing package
    [project.entry-points."nooa_cli.commands"]
    tui  = "my_package.cli.tui:command"
    term = "my_package.cli.term:command"

Rules:

* **Built-ins win name collisions.** A plugin cannot shadow ``eval``,
  ``config`` or any other command shipped here — it is logged and skipped.
* **Broken plugins are skipped, not fatal.** An entry point that fails to
  import, or that resolves to something other than a ``click.Command``, logs a
  warning and is left out; ``nooa`` keeps working.
* Plugins are registered in entry-point-name order, so ``nooa --help`` is
  stable regardless of install order.
* **Keep imports lazy**, exactly as for in-repo commands: every registered
  entry point is loaded on *every* ``nooa`` invocation, including
  ``nooa --help``, so heavy imports belong inside the command handler.
