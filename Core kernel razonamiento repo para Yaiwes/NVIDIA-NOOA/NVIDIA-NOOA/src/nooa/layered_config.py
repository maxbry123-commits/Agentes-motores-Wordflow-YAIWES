"""Shared layered-config discovery for NVIDIA OO Agents.

One mental model for *every* config file the project ships — LLM aliases
(``llm_config.yaml``), TUI settings (``settings.yaml``), and secrets
(``secrets.yaml``). All three live in the same directories, share the
same precedence rules, and are discovered through the helpers here.

Precedence (low → high, last wins):

1. **Bundled defaults** — supplied by the caller as *prepend* paths
   (e.g. the entry-point YAMLs for LLM config). Nothing is bundled for
   settings or secrets.
2. **User** — ``get_user_dir(filename)``
   (``~/.config/nooa/<filename>``).
3. **Project** — ``get_project_dir(filename)``
   (``<project-root>/.nooa/<filename>``).
4. **Env-var path override** — a comma-separated list of YAML paths in
   the named environment variable (``NEMO_OO_LLM_CONFIG``,
   ``NEMO_OO_SETTINGS``, ``NEMO_OO_SECRETS``). Highest priority so a
   shell session can override files without editing them.

Two entry points:

- :func:`layered_paths` returns the priority-ordered, deduplicated list
  of existing YAML paths (lowest priority first). Use it when a
  downstream consumer wants the *paths* (e.g. the LLM registry, which
  does its own last-wins merge).
- :func:`load_layered_yaml` reads those paths and deep-merges them into
  a single dict (last wins; ``null`` deletes a key). Use it for settings
  and secrets.

Resolved-path deduplication: each path is canonicalised via
:meth:`pathlib.Path.resolve` so symlink aliases and repeated entries
collapse. When the same resolved path appears in multiple layers, the
**lower-priority occurrence is dropped and the higher-priority position
is kept** — matching the last-wins semantics described above.
