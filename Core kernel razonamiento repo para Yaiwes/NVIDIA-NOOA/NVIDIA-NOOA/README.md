NVIDIA-labs Object Oriented Agents (NOOA) is a model-agnostic Python framework designed to support reliable AI agent development. Many agent frameworks represent prompts, tools, callbacks, and workflows as separate abstractions. NOOA offers an alternative object-oriented interface that brings these concepts together in a Python class. NOOA lets developers express an agent’s state, capabilities, prompts, and typed interfaces through a single Python class:

```python
from nooa import Agent

# The agent is a Python object.
class SupportAgent(Agent):
    """You are a support agent."""

    # State lives on the object. Fields are typed.
    order_db: OrderDB

    # Ordinary method. Just Python.
    def is_refund_eligible(self, order: Order) -> bool:
        return order.delivered and order.days_since_delivery <= 30

    # Agentic method: the runtime hands this to an LLM.
    async def triage(self, message: str, order: Order) -> Ticket:
        """Create a typed support ticket."""
        ...
```

**What's happening here:**

- **Agents are Python objects.** Fields are state, methods are capabilities, docstrings are prompts, type annotations are contracts.
- **`...` bodies are LLM-driven.** A method with `...` becomes an agentic loop; a real body stays deterministic Python.
- **Code as action.** The model acts by writing Python in a Jupyter-style REPL with access to `self`, imports, and helpers — Python methods and type annotations supply the callable interfaces, reducing the need to write separate tool-schema definitions.
- **Pythonic and agent-ready.** Typed I/O with auto-retry, live-object arguments passed by reference, and model-callable context and event APIs — designed around agent-oriented Python workflows.

This design supports familiar Python testing, tracing, refactoring, and version-control workflows — **just like the rest of your software**. Read [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.20709) for the design principles and evaluation results.

Want to see how the pieces compose? Take the [**10-minute tour**](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/labs-OO-Agents/blob/main/docs/tour.md), from one thinking method through tools, typed contracts, deterministic orchestration, and object composition.

## Installation

Add the **core** framework to a new (or existing) Python project with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/):

```bash
uv init my-agent-project
cd my-agent-project

uv add nooa
```

Or with pip: `pip install nooa`.

<details>
<summary><b>Optional sub-packages</b> — CLI, ACP, memory, benchmarks, evaluation pipeline</summary>

<br />

The CLI, ACP, memory, and benchmark packages are separate distributions. Install
them by name, or pull them in as extras of the core package:

```bash
uv add nooa-cli                 # or: uv add "nooa[cli]"
uv add nooa-acp                 # or: uv add "nooa[acp]"
uv add nooa-memory              # or: uv add "nooa[memory]"
uv add nooa-bench               # or: uv add "nooa[bench]"

uv add "nooa[cli,memory]"       # several at once
```

| Package | Extra | What it adds |
|---|---|---|
| `nooa-cli` | `nooa[cli]` | the `nooa` command, trace viewer, eval runner |
| `nooa-acp` | `nooa[acp]` | coding agent for Agent Client Protocol hosts such as Zed — [setup](packages/nooa-acp/README.md) |
| `nooa-memory` | `nooa[memory]` | long-term memory subsystem (`MemoryManager`) |
| `nooa-bench` | `nooa[bench]` | `BenchAgent` and the Harbor benchmark runner |

`eval_pipeline` is not published to PyPI — install it from the repo:

```bash
uv add "eval_pipeline @ git+https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/labs-OO-Agents.git@main#subdirectory=util/eval_pipeline"
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Installing from source</b> — track <code>main</code> or pin a tag</summary>

<br />

```bash
# latest development state
uv add "nooa @ git+https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/labs-OO-Agents.git@main"

# pinned to a release tag
uv add "nooa @ git+https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/labs-OO-Agents.git@v0.0.7"
```

## Quick Start

### ⚠️ Before Starting: safety note
NOOA is **research software**, and agents can be configured to execute LLM-generated code. We welcome contributions and fixes, but expect rough edges. LLM-generated code may take dangerous or unwanted actions, including sending private data to uncontrolled locations, deleting files, or modifying its environments.  Ensure you run NOOA agents in a sandboxed environment isolated from your primary filesystem, such as [NVIDIA OpenShell](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell).


NOOA validates generated code (AST checks) and applies module deny-lists before execution. **These are defense-in-depth guardrails, not a containment boundary.** They exist to keep generated code from freezing the event loop and to catch common mistakes early — not to stop code that is actively trying to escape. A static checker over Python cannot provide that guarantee: `open()` gives arbitrary file access, `importlib` can load modules straight from a path, and reflection reaches the rest. **The containment boundary is OS-level isolation** — always run agents that execute generated code inside a sandbox such as a container, VM, or [NVIDIA OpenShell](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell). Do not rely on the in-process validators alone.


### 1. Choose a model

Choose from supported hosted or local [LiteLLM-supported](https://docs.litellm.ai/) model:

```python
from nooa.unifiedllm.registry import get_llm_client

llm = get_llm_client("claude-haiku-4-5")                                            # Anthropic (after `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...`)
llm = get_llm_client("gpt-5-mini")                                                  # OpenAI    (after `export OPENAI_API_KEY=...`)
llm = get_llm_client("ollama_chat/qwen3:1.7b", api_base="http://localhost:11434")   # Ollama    (no key)
llm = get_llm_client("hosted_vllm/Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B", api_base="http://localhost:8000/v1")  # vLLM (no key)
```

### 2. Your first agent

***Agents are Python objects***. Methods with `...` bodies are **generation methods** — implemented at runtime by an LLM-driven strategy. The signature defines the contract; the docstring is the prompt.

```python
import asyncio

from nooa import Agent


class FeedbackAgent(Agent, llm=llm):
    """You are an agent specializing in analyzing customer feedback."""

    async def analyze_feedback(self, text: str) -> str:
        """Analyze customer feedback for sentiment and key topics in one sentence."""
        ...


async def main():
    agent = FeedbackAgent()
    result = await agent.analyze_feedback("Great product, but shipping was slow")
    print(result)


asyncio.run(main())
```

Run the same code from your own project with `python`. You can run the checked-in example:

```bash
uv run python examples/quickstart/01_first_generation_method.py
```

Rename `analyze_feedback` to `analyze_feedback_briefly` and the output changes — your method name, parameters, and docstring *are* the prompt.

Prefer a guided notebook path? Start with the [**notebook tutorials**](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/labs-OO-Agents/blob/main/notebook_tutorials/README.md), which walk through the same ideas in Colab-friendly steps, with more notebooks planned.

Ready to run something specific? Use the [**examples catalog**](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/labs-OO-Agents/blob/main/examples/README.md) to find quickstarts for structured output, tools, strategies, tracing, context blocks, MCP, and more.

### 3. See what your agent is doing

Every LLM call, code execution, and method invocation is traced by default — orchestrators, generation methods, and helpers, with parent-child spans preserved. If you installed the CLI and viewer dependencies, start the trace viewer and open the run in your browser:

```bash
uv run nooa start-dev        # trace viewer on http://localhost:5001
```

If the viewer isn't running, tracing is silently disabled — no configuration needed either way.
