## The problem

You prompt Claude Code with "research X." It does a surface-level pass in 20 minutes and stops. No structure, no verification, no memory across sessions.

**deepresearch** fixes this. It decomposes your research into 80-120 atomic tasks, spawns isolated subagents for each, verifies every output against schemas, and self-improves the researcher over time. Every factual claim gets a provenance envelope and an adversarial verification pass. One command to start. Walk away. Come back to research you can actually trust.

### What you get

- **Adversarial verification** — a dedicated adversary agent attacks every claim, checking source support, searching for contradictions, and cross-referencing. Claims that survive get a trust score. Claims that don't get flagged.
- **Epistemic provenance** — high-value fields carry a 12-field provenance envelope: source URL, extraction method, cross-references, confidence score, adversary verdict, and survival score
- **Self-improving researcher** that gets better each phase — the adversary's attack patterns are fed forward as defensive instructions, training the researcher to produce un-attackable claims
- **Trust score dashboard** — `Trust: 87% survived | Score: 0.74` at a glance, plus a most-attacked leaderboard
- **Multi-session research** that picks up exactly where it left off
- **Parallel execution** with automatic dependency analysis (~4% overhead in sequential mode, near-zero in parallel)
- **Autonomous mode** for overnight unattended runs
- **Anti-hallucination rules** baked in: `NOT_FOUND` over guessing, sources required, conflicts flagged

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HadiFrt20/deepresearch.git ~/.claude/skills/deepresearch
cd ~/.claude/skills/deepresearch && ./setup
```

That's it. No dependencies. No build step. Open a new Claude Code session and the commands are available.

## Quick start

```
/dr-new     → interactive setup: 11 questions, full project scaffold
/dr-run     → execute tasks autonomously
/dr-status  → progress dashboard
```

`/dr-new` interviews you about your research goal, scope, and preferences, then generates 11 files: execution protocol, 80-120 tasks, schemas, eval criteria, and project-local subagents. `/dr-run` takes it from there.

## How it works

### Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/architecture.png?v=2" alt="deepresearch architecture" width="800">
</p>

deepresearch has four layers that work together:

**User Commands** — Seven skills (`/dr-new`, `/dr-run`, `/dr-status`, `/dr-review`, `/dr-resume`, `/dr-improve`, `/dr-report`) drive the workflow from project setup to final deliverable.

**Orchestration** — The execution engine reads `CLAUDE.md` and `todo.md`, spawns subagents for each task, verifies output against JSON schemas, and logs results to `CHANGELOG.md`. A mode router selects sequential (one task at a time) or parallel (batches of 5 with dependency analysis).

**Subagents** — Four specialized agents, each with a focused role:
- **dr-researcher** — executes a single research micro-task with structured output, provenance envelopes, and source caching
- **dr-adversary** — attacks completed claims by checking source support, searching for contradictions, and cross-referencing
- **dr-planner** — analyzes task dependencies for parallel safety, classifies tasks as SAFE/RISKY/BLOCKING
- **dr-evaluator** — scores data against binary eval criteria including adversary survival rate

**Project Files** — `CLAUDE.md`, `todo.md`, `.research/ROADMAP.md`, `.research/CHANGELOG.md`, `.research/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `.research/evals.md`, `data/*.json`, and `data/*.adversary.json` (sidecar files) provide persistent state across sessions.

### Three loops

```
Research loop (/dr-run)                 Trust loop (adversary)                  Improvement loop (/dr-improve)
───────────────────────                 ──────────────────────                  ──────────────────────────────
find task → spawn researcher →          every 5 tasks → spawn adversary →      score data + adversary verdicts →
verify output → add provenance →        check sources → find contradictions →  extract attack patterns →
mark done/fail → log → next task        cross-reference → write verdicts       inject as "known vulnerabilities" →
                                                                               re-run sample → keep if better
```

The researcher's prompt is the **trainable parameter**. Adversary survival rate is the **metric**. The adversary trains the researcher to produce harder-to-attack claims. Research that's been trained by its own worst critic.

## Adversarial verification

Every 5 completed tasks, a `dr-adversary` agent attacks the research claims:

| Mode | What it checks |
|------|---------------|
| **Source verification** | Fetches the cited URL — does it actually say what the researcher claims? |
| **Contradiction search** | Searches for counter-evidence with negated queries |
| **Cross-reference check** | Are "independent" sources actually independent, or all citing the same original? |
| **Temporal check** | Is the source too old for a time-sensitive claim? |

Every refuted or weakened verdict requires a **direct quote** from the source. No quote, no refutation — downgrades to `unverifiable`. This prevents adversary overreach.

Results are written to sidecar files (`data/*.adversary.json`), never modifying the researcher's output. `dr-status` and `dr-report` merge data + sidecar at read time.

```
Trust: 87% survived | Score: 0.74
Adversary: 45/52 claims reviewed (7 pending)
```

Skip adversarial verification with `--no-adversary` when you want speed over trust:

```
/dr-run --no-adversary          # provenance still produced, adversary skipped
```

### Provenance envelopes

The 3 highest-value fields per entity (chosen during `/dr-new`) get full 12-field provenance tracking:

```json
{
  "claim_text": "CrewAI raised $18M Series A",
  "source_url": "https://crunchbase.com/organization/crewai",
  "extraction_method": "direct_quote",
  "cross_ref_count": 2,
  "confidence_score": 0.9,
  "volatility_class": "medium",
  "adversary_verdict": "confirmed",
  "survival_score": 0.9
}
```

All other factual fields get a simple `"sourced": true/false` flag. Non-factual fields (identifiers, status) get no provenance. ~2x output tokens per entity, ~4% time overhead in sequential mode.

---

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/dr-new` | Interactive setup (11 questions, incl. provenance field selection) then full project scaffold |
| `/dr-run` | Autonomous task execution with adversarial verification every 5 tasks |
| `/dr-run --no-adversary` | Execute without adversarial verification (faster, less trust) |
| `/dr-status` | Dashboard: tasks, phases, data completeness, trust score, most-attacked entities |
| `/dr-review` | Audit data quality against schemas |
| `/dr-resume` | Pick up where you left off after a break |
| `/dr-improve` | Self-improvement loop — uses adversary attack patterns to train the researcher |
| `/dr-report` | Synthesize findings with [REFUTED]/[WEAKENED] markers on contested claims |
| `/dr-report --provenance` | Also export `output/provenance-chain.json` — full epistemic audit trail |

---

## Execution modes

Control how tasks run. Set the default during `/dr-new` or override per-run:

| Mode | Command | Best for |
|------|---------|----------|
| Sequential | `/dr-run sequential` | First runs, debugging |
| Sequential + auto-improve | `/dr-run sequential-auto-improve` | Quality-focused research |
| Parallel (batches of 5) | `/dr-run parallel` | Speed, large task sets |
| Parallel + auto-improve | `/dr-run parallel-auto-improve` | Overnight runs |

**Parallel mode safety:** Before the first parallel run, a `dr-planner` subagent analyzes task dependencies and classifies each as SAFE, RISKY, BLOCKING, or CROSS-PHASE. Race conditions on shared files are handled with temp files and atomic merges.

---

## Autonomous mode

The default permission mode is set during `/dr-new` (question A9). In "ask" mode, `/dr-run` requests approval on every web search, fetch, and file write. Safe, but blocks overnight runs.

```
/dr-run auto                  # fully autonomous, no prompts
/dr-run parallel auto         # parallel + autonomous
```

**Auto mode is independent of execution mode** — it controls permissions (ask vs don't ask), not strategy (sequential vs parallel). Combine freely.

Safety rails still apply in auto mode:
- Source URLs required for every claim
- `NOT_FOUND` over guessing (never invents data)
- 10-minute time budget per task
- 3 consecutive failures stops the run (parallel mode falls back to sequential first)
- 3-hour cumulative runtime stops the run
- Rate-limit detection triggers checkpoints
- `Ctrl+C` to interrupt at any time

Set auto as the project default during `/dr-new` (question A9), or override per-run with `/dr-run auto` or `/dr-run ask`.

---

## Tool support

During `/dr-new`, pick your research tools. The choice auto-configures the researcher subagent and CLAUDE.md.

| Tool | What it adds |
|------|-------------|
| **Native** (WebSearch + WebFetch) | Works out of the box, no setup |
| **Firecrawl MCP** | Search, scrape, crawl, site mapping |
| **Linkup MCP** | Search with structured extraction |
| **Tavily MCP** | Search optimized for AI agents |
| **Multiple** | Combine any of the above |

Change tools later by editing the Tool priority section in your project's CLAUDE.md.

---

## Self-improvement

`/dr-improve` runs a ratchet loop on the researcher subagent:

1. **Score** current data against eval criteria + adversary survival rate
2. **Analyze** failure patterns — which criteria fail, which claims get attacked
3. **Extract attack patterns** from adversary verdicts (fields + methods that get refuted 2+ times)
4. **Inject "Known Vulnerabilities"** into the researcher's Data Rules (max 5, oldest replaced)
5. **Mutate** 1-3 concrete instructions in the researcher prompt
6. **Re-run** a sample of failed tasks with the new researcher
7. **Score again** and **keep if better, revert if not**

The adversary's attacks become the researcher's defenses. Each improvement cycle produces a researcher that's harder to attack.

```
/dr-improve              # single improvement cycle
/dr-improve --cycles 3   # three rounds
/dr-improve --criteria   # add new eval criteria first
```

All versions are saved to `.research/eval-history/`. In auto-improve execution modes, this runs automatically between phases. If no adversary data exists yet, adversary criteria are auto-skipped.

---

## Data quality guarantees

Every research entry follows strict rules:

| Rule | What it means |
|------|--------------|
| `NOT_FOUND` | Could not find this data point. Never guesses. |
| `UNVERIFIED: {value}` | Single-source claim, not cross-referenced |
| `CONFLICTING: {v1} vs {v2}` | Sources disagree, both values preserved |
| `INACCESSIBLE` | Website down or blocked |
| `sources[]` required | Every entry must cite at least 1 URL |
| `status` required | COMPLETE, INCOMPLETE, or INACCESSIBLE |
