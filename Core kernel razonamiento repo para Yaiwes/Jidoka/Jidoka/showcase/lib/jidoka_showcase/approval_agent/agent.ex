  Use this route to see a human review interrupt before a sensitive operation
  runs.

  Ask for a refund on order B2002. The agent should plan the refund operation,
  Jidoka should hibernate the turn for review, and the UI should let you
  approve or reject the pending action.

  The review request is data on the snapshot. Approving resumes the snapshot
  and executes the pending operation; rejecting resumes into a deterministic
  approval error.
