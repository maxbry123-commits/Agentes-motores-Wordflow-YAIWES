# Agent Orchestration

Use this guide when more than one agent is involved in a user flow.

Jidoka has two orchestration primitives that look similar in the DSL but mean
different things:

- **Subagent**: run another agent for one bounded task inside the current turn.
  The parent keeps ownership and receives the child result.
- **Handoff**: record that another agent owns future turns for the
  conversation. The current turn completes, and your application routes the
  next user message to the recorded owner.

Both are authored in `tools do ... end`, both compile to operations, and both
can forward context. They differ in lifetime, ownership, and return shape.

## When To Use This

- Use **subagent** when a parent agent needs a specialist answer before it can
  finish its own response.
- Use **handoff** when the specialist should become the agent for the next user
  message.
- Use **workflow** instead when the steps are deterministic application logic
  and do not need another model persona.
- Use **Jido process hosting** separately when you need agents supervised in a
  process tree. Orchestration is about who does the work, not how processes are
  hosted.

## Quick Decision Table

| Question | Use |
| --- | --- |
| "Can another agent answer this side question for the parent?" | `subagent` |
| "Should a different persona own the next message?" | `handoff` |
| "Should the parent synthesize the child answer now?" | `subagent` |
| "Should the app route future turns elsewhere until reset?" | `handoff` |
| "Do I need an operation result in this turn?" | `subagent` |
| "Do I need durable routing state?" | `handoff` |

## Mental Model

```text
Subagent
user -> parent agent -> child agent turn -> child result -> parent final answer

Handoff
user -> current agent -> handoff record -> current final answer
next user message -> app dispatcher -> recorded owner agent
```

A subagent is a nested call. A handoff is routing state.

## Subagent Flow

Define a child agent with its own instructions, model, controls, and tools.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.EvidenceAgent do
  use Jidoka.Agent

  agent :evidence_agent do
    model "openai:gpt-4o-mini"
    instructions "Answer one evidence question. Be concise."
  end
end
```

Register it in the parent agent.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.SupportAgent do
  use Jidoka.Agent

  agent :support_agent do
    model "openai:gpt-4o-mini"
    instructions "Use evidence_specialist before answering disputed claims."
  end

  tools do
    subagent MyApp.EvidenceAgent,
      as: :evidence_specialist,
      description: "Checks one bounded evidence question.",
      timeout: 30_000,
      forward_context: {:only, [:tenant, :case_id]},
      result: :structured
  end
end
```

When the parent model calls `evidence_specialist`, Jidoka runs one child turn.
The child receives:

- `task` from the operation arguments as its input;
- forwarded context controlled by `forward_context:`;
- optional task-local `context` from the operation arguments;
- its own agent spec, controls, tools, model settings, and loop budget.

The parent receives an operation result like:

```elixir
%{
  subagent: "evidence_specialist",
  agent: "MyApp.EvidenceAgent",
  content: "The account was upgraded on May 12.",
  value: %{status: "confirmed"},
  operation_results: []
}
```

The parent then continues the same turn and produces the final answer.
Conversation ownership never changes.

If the child hibernates, the parent turn also hibernates. The parent snapshot
stores the child snapshot as a durable operation continuation. Resume the
parent snapshot, not the child snapshot:

```elixir
{:hibernate, parent_snapshot} =
  Jidoka.turn(MyApp.SupportAgent, "Check the evidence.",
    llm: parent_llm,
    operation_context: %{
      subagent_llm: child_llm,
      subagent_opts: [checkpoint: :before_each_effect]
    }
  )

{:ok, result} =
  Jidoka.resume(parent_snapshot,
    llm: parent_llm,
    operation_context: %{subagent_llm: child_llm},
    nested_resume_opts: [checkpoint: :none]
  )
```

Use `nested_resume_opts:` for fresh runtime-only child options. For example,
put a child approval response in this list. Jidoka does not store model
functions, credentials, or process handles in the continuation.

## Handoff Flow

Define the target agent that should own future turns.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.BillingAgent do
  use Jidoka.Agent

  agent :billing_agent do
    model "openai:gpt-4o-mini"
    instructions "Own billing follow-up."
  end
end
```

Register a handoff operation in the current agent.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.SupportRouter do
  use Jidoka.Agent

  agent :support_router do
    model "openai:gpt-4o-mini"
    instructions "Hand off billing issues to billing_specialist."
  end

  tools do
    handoff MyApp.BillingAgent,
      as: :billing_specialist,
      description: "Transfers future billing follow-up to billing.",
      forward_context: {:only, [:tenant, :case_id, :session_id]}
  end
end
```

When the model calls `billing_specialist`, Jidoka records a
`Jidoka.Handoff` in the owner store. The handoff contains:

- `conversation_id`;
- source and target agent information;
- target `agent_id`;
- handoff `message`;
- optional `summary` and `reason`;
- forwarded context.

The current agent still receives an operation result and finishes its response.
Jidoka does not automatically route the next user message. Your app dispatcher
does that:

```elixir
def dispatch(conversation_id, input, opts \\ []) do
  case Jidoka.handoff(conversation_id) do
    %{agent: owner_agent, handoff: handoff} ->
      Jidoka.chat(
        owner_agent,
        input,
        Keyword.put(
          opts,
          :context,
          Map.merge(handoff.context, %{handoff_summary: handoff.summary})
        )
      )

    nil ->
      Jidoka.chat(MyApp.SupportRouter, input, opts)
  end
end
```

Reset ownership when the specialist is done:

```elixir
:ok = Jidoka.reset_handoff("case-123")
```

## Context Rules

Subagents and handoffs both accept `forward_context:`.

| Policy | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `:public` | Forward the public parent context. |
| `:none` | Forward nothing. |
| `{:only, keys}` | Forward only listed keys. |
| `{:except, keys}` | Forward everything except listed keys. |

Prefer `{:only, keys}` for orchestration. It makes the boundary explicit and
keeps secrets out of child prompts and handoff records.

Operation arguments can also include a task-local `context` map. Jidoka merges
that with the forwarded context for the target.

When testing a DSL agent directly and you want operation sources to see the
same context as the turn request, put the data on the request `context:`:

```elixir
request =
  Jidoka.Turn.Request.new!(
    input: "Route this billing issue.",
    context: %{session_id: "case-123", tenant: "acme"}
  )

Jidoka.turn(MyApp.SupportRouter, request,
  llm: fake_llm
)
```

That is the context source used by `forward_context:`. Provider credentials,
runtime handles, and other private values belong in `operation_context:` and
are available through `Jidoka.Context.get_runtime/3`.

## Result And Ownership Rules

| Concern | Subagent | Handoff |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Current turn | Parent waits for child result. | Current agent records transfer and finishes. |
| Future turns | Parent still owns them. | Target agent owns them until reset. |
| Return shape | Child content, value, and child operation results. | Handoff payload plus owner projection. |
| Safety | `:idempotent` by default. | `:unsafe_once`; gate with approval or a control when needed. |
| Storage | No routing state is written. | Owner store records the target. |

## Testing Pattern

Test subagents by asserting the child agent actually received the bounded task
and that the parent saw the child result.

```elixir
assert {:ok, result} =
         Jidoka.turn(
           MyApp.SupportAgent,
           Jidoka.Turn.Request.new!(
             input: "Check the evidence.",
             context: %{tenant: "acme", secret: "do-not-forward"}
           ),
           llm: fake_llm,
           operation_context: %{subagent_llm: fake_llm}
         )

assert [%{operation: "evidence_specialist", output: output}] =
         Enum.map(result.agent_state.operation_results, &Jidoka.project/1)

assert output.content =~ "confirmed"
```

Test handoffs by asserting ownership was recorded, then call your dispatcher
with the next user message.

```elixir
request =
  Jidoka.Turn.Request.new!(
    input: "This is a billing issue.",
    context: %{session_id: "case-123", tenant: "acme"}
  )

assert {:ok, _result} =
         Jidoka.turn(MyApp.SupportRouter, request,
           llm: fake_llm
         )

assert %{agent: MyApp.BillingAgent, handoff: handoff} =
         Jidoka.handoff("case-123")

assert handoff.context == %{tenant: "acme", session_id: "case-123"}

assert {:ok, _reply} = dispatch("case-123", "What happens next?")
```

Reset handoff state in `setup` or `on_exit` when tests use the default
in-memory owner store.

## Common Frictions

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Child agent sees too much context | `forward_context: :public` was too broad. | Use `{:only, [...]}`. |
| Parent expects future routing after subagent | Wrong primitive. | Use `handoff`. |
| Handoff records owner but next message still hits router | App dispatcher does not read `Jidoka.handoff/1`. | Add routing before default agent selection. |
| Handoff result lacks conversation id | No `conversation_id`, `conversation`, or `session_id` was present. | Pass one in arguments or context. |
| Parent hibernates while a subagent runs | The child hit HITL or a checkpoint. | Resume the parent snapshot and pass fresh child values with `nested_resume_opts:`. |
