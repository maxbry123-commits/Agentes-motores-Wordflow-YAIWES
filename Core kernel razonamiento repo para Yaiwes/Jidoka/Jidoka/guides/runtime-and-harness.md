# Runtime And Execution Layers

This is a maintainer guide for the internal execution layers. Application code
must use the `Jidoka` facade and the public data contracts instead of these
modules.

Jidoka separates authoring, executable data, and effect execution.

## When To Use This

- Use this guide when you maintain the turn runner, session execution, review
  execution, or an adapter.
- Use this guide when you must trace dependency direction through an internal
  execution path.
- For application development, start with [Getting Started](getting-started.md)
  and [Public Facade](public-facade.md).

```text
Jidoka.Agent DSL
-> Jidoka.Agent.Spec
-> Jidoka.Turn.Plan
-> Jidoka.Turn.Execution
-> Jidoka.Runtime.TurnRunner
-> Jidoka.Adapter.Runic.TurnCompiler
-> pure spine steps
-> Effect interpreter
-> Jidoka.Adapter.ReqLLM / Jidoka.Operation.Source
```

For process-hosted agents, `Jido.AgentServer` sits around the same turn use
case:

```text
Jido.AgentServer
-> Jido.Signal "jidoka.turn.run"
-> Jidoka.Adapter.Jido.RunTurn
-> Jidoka.Turn.Execution
-> Jido agent state update
```

## Execution Use Cases

Three modules own execution workflows:

- `Jidoka.Turn.Execution` owns direct turns, request normalization, runtime
  capabilities, memory setup, and snapshot resume.
- `Jidoka.Session.Execution` owns session creation, leases, checkpoints,
  recovery, forks, replay, and session memory.
- `Jidoka.Review.Execution` owns pending review lists and approval or denial
  resume work.

`Jidoka.Harness` is now a thin compatibility delegate. New internal code calls
the owner module. Normal application code uses `Jidoka` and `Jidoka.Session`.

## Sessions And Stores

`Jidoka.Session` is the ergonomic API for durable sessions. It delegates to
`Jidoka.Session.Execution`. The underlying data struct is
`Jidoka.Session.Data`.

`Jidoka.Session.Data` is the durable session envelope for work that spans
requests or process restarts. It contains:

- the canonical agent spec;
- request history;
- hibernated snapshots;
- pending review requests;
- the latest result or error;
- optional fork lineage;
- metadata owned by the application.

Sessions are still data. They do not contain runtime clients or processes.

```elixir
{:ok, pid} = Jidoka.Session.Store.InMemory.start_link()
store = {Jidoka.Session.Store.InMemory, pid: pid}

{:ok, session} =
  Jidoka.session(spec, "support-session-1", store: store)

{:hibernate, session, snapshot} =
  Jidoka.Session.run(session.session_id, "Hello",
    store: store,
    llm: llm,
    checkpoint: :after_prompt
  )

{:ok, session, result} =
  Jidoka.Session.resume(session.session_id,
    store: store,
    llm: llm
  )

{:ok, branch} =
  Jidoka.Session.fork(session,
    session_id: "support-session-1-alternate"
  )
```

A fork copies one stored, safe hibernation snapshot into a new session. It
keeps the effect journal, records root and parent lineage, and leaves the
source session unchanged. It does not support arbitrary state editing,
cursor movement, or effect re-execution.

The base store behaviour is small: put/get/list sessions. Lease-aware adapters
also implement claim, resume claim, checkpoint, renewal, recovery, and commit
transitions. Pending review listing is derived from stored session data:

```elixir
{:ok, reviews} = Jidoka.Session.pending_reviews(store)
```

Replay is a projection over stored data, not a runtime call. Fork is the
separate API that creates a runnable branch:

```elixir
{:ok, replay} = Jidoka.Session.replay(session)
replay.timeline
replay.lineage
```

For crash recovery, `Jidoka.Session.recoverable/2` lists expired leased work
that has a durable snapshot. `Jidoka.Session.recover/2` atomically takes a new
lease and resumes it. `Jidoka.Session.Store.Dets` provides a synced,
single-node disk adapter. A multi-node deployment can implement the same store
callbacks with database compare-and-set transactions.

Replay diagnostics explain whether recorded effects are complete and safe to
reason about without calling providers or tools:

```elixir
{:ok, diagnostics} = Jidoka.Session.Replay.diagnose(replay)

diagnostics.status
#=> :complete | :waiting | :failed | :incomplete

diagnostics.missing_effect_results
diagnostics.unsafe_effects
diagnostics.pending_reviews
```

Diagnostic statuses are intentionally small:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `:complete` | The replay has complete effect result data. |
| `:waiting` | Human review is pending, usually from an interrupted operation control. |
| `:failed` | At least one effect result or timeline event failed. |
| `:incomplete` | An effect intent exists without a recorded result. |

Use `Jidoka.Debug.request/2` when you want a request-level view that combines
prompt metadata, operation results, usage, timeline, journal, and replay
diagnostics:

```elixir
{:ok, summary} = Jidoka.Debug.request(result)
summary.prompt.messages
summary.replay_diagnostics.status
```

For hibernated work, pass the snapshot directly. Add `session:` when you want
the session id attached to the summary:

```elixir
{:hibernate, session, snapshot} = Jidoka.Session.run(session, "Refund A1001")

{:ok, summary} = Jidoka.Debug.request(snapshot, session: session)
summary.pending_reviews
summary.replay_diagnostics.status
```

## Observability And Evals

Core runtime events are neutral `Jidoka.Event` data. `Jidoka.Trace` projects
them into a compact timeline, and callers decide whether to persist that
timeline:

```elixir
{:ok, sink} = Jidoka.Trace.Sink.InMemory.start_link()

:ok =
  Jidoka.Trace.record(result.events, {Jidoka.Trace.Sink.InMemory, pid: sink},
    policy:
      Jidoka.Trace.Policy.new!(
        sample_rate: 1.0,
        redact_keys: [:api_key, :authorization],
        omit_keys: [:messages, :prompt]
      )
  )
```

`Jidoka.inspect/1` returns stable views for agents, turns, snapshots, sessions,
replay, effect journals, review objects, memory results, and eval runs. These
views are projection-oriented and avoid provider-specific client data.

Eval cases are deterministic harness fixtures:

```elixir
{:ok, run} =
  Jidoka.Eval.run_case(
    [
      id: "support_lookup",
      agent: spec,
      input: "Check account acct_123",
      assertions: %{
        contains: "acct_123",
        operation_called: "lookup_account"
      }
    ],
    llm: llm,
    operations: operations
  )
```

The eval runner does not add another agent runtime. It uses
`Jidoka.Turn.Execution.run/3`, then records assertion results and observations
on `Jidoka.Eval.Run`.

Eval input validation and eval execution failures are intentionally different:

- invalid eval case data returns `{:error, reason}`;
- a harness runtime error returns `{:ok, %Jidoka.Eval.Run{status: :error}}`;
- a hibernated turn also returns `{:ok, %Jidoka.Eval.Run{status: :error}}`
  with `%{reason: :hibernated, snapshot: ...}` in `run.error`.

That keeps eval outcomes serializable as evidence while still rejecting invalid
eval definitions before execution.

## Memory

Memory is opt-in agent policy plus per-run store capability:

```elixir
spec =
  Jidoka.agent!(
    id: "support_agent",
    instructions: "Use recalled memory when useful.",
    memory: %{scope: :session, max_entries: 5}
  )

{:ok, pid} = Jidoka.Memory.Store.InMemory.start_link()
memory_store = {Jidoka.Memory.Store.InMemory, pid: pid}

{:ok, _write} =
  Jidoka.Session.Execution.write_memory(spec, "Ada prefers concise answers.",
    memory_store: memory_store
  )
```

Before prompt assembly, turn execution recalls memory through the supplied store
and passes a typed `Jidoka.Memory.RecallResult` into the Runic turn state.
Prompt assembly then:

- adds a `memory_recalled` trace event when entries are present;
- adds a compact "Relevant memory" system message;
- exposes `prompt.memory` for preflight, tests, and provider runtime code.

`Jidoka.preflight/3` accepts the same `memory_store:` option, so memory
contributions are visible without calling an LLM.

## Operation Sources

Jidoka keeps one runtime operation path. Different executable surfaces should
compile into `Agent.Spec.Operation` plus a capability function:

```elixir
source =
  Jidoka.Operation.Source.Local.new!(
    operations: [
      %{
        name: "lookup_ticket",
        description: "Looks up a ticket.",
        kind: :tool,
        handler: fn args, _ctx -> %{ticket_id: args["ticket_id"], status: "open"} end
      }
    ]
  )

{:ok, compiled} = Jidoka.Operation.Source.compile(source)

spec =
  Jidoka.agent!(
    id: "support_agent",
    instructions: "Use lookup_ticket when needed.",
    operations: compiled.operations
  )

Jidoka.turn(spec, "Check ticket T-100",
  llm: llm,
  operations: compiled.capability
)
```

Controls still match by operation `kind` and `name`. The local source above
uses kind `:tool`; Jido action sources use kind `:action`. Both execute through
the same `Effect.Intent` / `Effect.Result` journal path.

## Turn Runner

`Jidoka.Runtime.TurnRunner` owns the loop:

1. run input controls;
2. run the Runic prompt/effect planning workflow;
3. optionally hibernate at a safe checkpoint;
4. interpret pending effects through runtime capabilities; independent
   operation batches run through Runic with bounded concurrency;
5. apply effect results to turn state;
6. validate and optionally repair structured final results;
7. loop until final answer or max model turns;
8. run output controls before returning.

Operation controls run inside the effect interpreter immediately before an
operation capability is called. If a control returns `{:interrupt, reason}`, the
runner marks the turn state as `:waiting` and hibernates at a review cursor
instead of calling the operation.

When one LLM decision returns multiple operation calls, Jidoka keeps the
model's order in `pending_effects`, preflights controls for the batch, then
executes allowed operations in parallel. `:max_parallel_operations` can be
passed to `turn/3` / `resume/2`, or configured globally with
`:default_max_parallel_operations`. Checkpoint policies `:after_each_phase` and
`:before_each_effect` keep the older one-effect-at-a-time pause behavior for
debugging and durable replay.

## Effects

External work is represented as data:

```elixir
%Jidoka.Effect.Intent{
  kind: :llm | :operation,
  payload: %{},
  idempotency_key: "...",
  idempotency: :idempotent
}
```

The effect interpreter records intents and results in `Effect.Journal`. On
resume, existing results are reused instead of re-running the same effect.
During a lease-backed session run, the harness also saves a snapshot after the
intent and after the result. The result checkpoint is durable before the turn
applies the result.

## Operation Idempotency

Every operation declares one idempotency policy:

- `:pure` means the operation can be recomputed from input;
- `:idempotent` means the runtime can safely retry with the same key;
- `:dedupe` means Jidoka should prefer a recorded journal result;
- `:reconcile` means incomplete work should be surfaced for application
  reconciliation;
- `:unsafe_once` means Jidoka must not retry automatically.

`:unsafe_once` operations require either an approval policy or an explicit
operation control. This makes risky work visible at preflight time instead of
discovering it after a model chooses the operation.

On recovery, incomplete `:dedupe` and `:reconcile` intents do not run
automatically. Incomplete `:unsafe_once` intents also stop. Only `:pure` and
`:idempotent` effects are automatic retry candidates, and they keep the same
idempotency key.

If a journal already has a result for an operation effect, resume replays that
result and does not call the operation capability again. If an `:unsafe_once`
intent was recorded without a result, resume returns a typed execution error
instead of retrying the operation. Later harness/session storage can use that
same shape to route the case to a reconciliation queue.

A suspended workflow or subagent operation is a controlled incomplete intent.
The parent snapshot stores its typed continuation. On resume, Jidoka routes the
continuation to that exact intent and source. Other completed intents in the
same operation group keep their journaled results.

## Durability

Jidoka snapshots semantic state:

```elixir
{:hibernate, snapshot} =
  Jidoka.turn(spec, "Hello",
    llm: llm,
    checkpoint: :after_prompt
  )

{:ok, result} = Jidoka.resume(snapshot, llm: llm)
```

Current checkpoint policies:

- `:none`
- `:after_prompt`
- `:after_each_phase`
- `:before_each_effect`

This is safe-boundary durability, not arbitrary process resurrection.

Versioned durability boundaries:

- `Jidoka.Snapshot.schema_version() == 2`;
- `Jidoka.Snapshot.supported_schema_versions() == [1, 2]`;
- `Jidoka.Snapshot.serialization_prefix() == "jidoka:snapshot:v1:"`;
- `Jidoka.Session.Data.schema_version() == 3`;
- `Jidoka.Session.Data.supported_schema_versions() == [1, 2, 3]`;
- import documents use `Jidoka.Import.AgentDocument.version() == 1`.

Unsupported versions fail during normalization instead of attempting a partial
resume/import.

## Human-In-The-Loop Review

An operation control can pause execution:

```elixir
def call(%Jidoka.Runtime.Controls.OperationContext{} = operation) do
  if operation.operation == "refund_order" do
    {:interrupt, :approval_required}
  else
    :cont
  end
end
```

The returned snapshot has:

- `cursor.phase == :review`;
- `turn_state.status == :waiting`;
- `turn_state.pending_interrupt` as a `Jidoka.Review.Interrupt`;
- `metadata["pending_review"]` as a `Jidoka.Review.Request`.

Resume with an approval response:

```elixir
approval = Jidoka.Review.Response.approve(snapshot.turn_state.pending_interrupt)
{:ok, result} = Jidoka.resume(snapshot, approval: approval, llm: llm, operations: operations)
```

Resume with a denial:

```elixir
denial = Jidoka.Review.Response.deny(snapshot.turn_state.pending_interrupt, reason: :rejected)
{:error, error} = Jidoka.resume(snapshot, approval: denial, llm: llm, operations: operations)
```

The approved operation resumes from the pending `Effect.Intent`; Jidoka does
not re-run operation controls for that approved interrupt. The journal still
prevents duplicate effect results on normal hibernate/resume boundaries.

## Structured Results

If `Agent.Spec.result` is present, a final model decision must include a
structured `result` value in addition to user-facing `content`:

```elixir
%{
  type: :final,
  content: "Ada is ready.",
  result: %{name: "Ada", confidence: 10}
}
```

The runtime validates the value with the configured Zoi schema before marking
the turn finished. Validated data is stored on `Turn.State.result_value` and
returned as `Turn.Result.value`. Output controls run after validation, so their
context receives both `result` text and `result_value` data.

If a model omits the explicit `result` field but returns JSON as `content`,
Jidoka attempts to validate that decoded JSON as the structured result. Plain
text content is still preserved for unstructured agents.

If validation fails and `max_repairs` has not been exhausted, Jidoka appends a
repair instruction to the durable agent state and runs another model turn. This
uses the same Runic/effect loop; it is not a provider-specific structured output
API.

## Jido Relationship

Jidoka uses Jido as the foundation:

- DSL agent modules are also `Jido.Agent` modules;
- tools are Jido actions;
- action schemas and execution stay on the Jido side.
- `Jidoka.Jido` is the default Jido runtime instance started by the Jidoka
  application module.
- `MyAgent.start/1` and `Jidoka.start_agent/2` start DSL agents under
  `Jido.AgentServer`.
- AgentServer routes `"jidoka.turn.run"` to `Jidoka.Adapter.Jido.RunTurn`,
  which runs the Jidoka harness and writes `:status`, `:last_answer`, and
  a typed `Jidoka.Adapter.Jido.AgentServerState` under `agent.state[:jidoka]`.

Jidoka does not delegate the core loop to `Jido.AI.ReAct`. The ReAct-style loop
is implemented through Jidoka's Runic/effect/harness spine.
