"""Smoke test: cocoindex-code local manifest loads and validates.

The manifest at
``src/bernstein/core/protocols/mcp_catalog/manifests/cocoindex_code.yaml``
ships inside the wheel as a "available, disabled by default" catalog
entry. This test makes sure:

* the YAML parses,
* it round-trips through the strict catalog validator,
* the catalog is "off" by default (operator must opt in via
  ``mcp.catalog.cocoindex_code.enabled``),
* the ``preview_local_manifest`` integration point can build an
  ``InstallPreview`` for it without actually installing cocoindex (the
  pip ``--dry-run`` install command is invoked).
