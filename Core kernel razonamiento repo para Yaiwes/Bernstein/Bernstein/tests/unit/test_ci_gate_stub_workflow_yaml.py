"""Structural and behavioural assertions on the `CI gate` stub.

``.github/workflows/ci-gate-stub.yml`` publishes a synthetic ``CI gate``
check so that pull requests whose diff is entirely contained in
``ci.yml``'s ``paths-ignore`` list are not blocked forever by a context
that will never run. That is the only case it may serve.

The failure this module exists to prevent
-----------------------------------------
``paths``/``paths-ignore`` filters are evaluated per file with OR
semantics, so on a *mixed* diff (some files ignored, some not) both
``ci.yml`` and the stub fire. Both published ``CI gate``; the synthetic
one completed in seconds while the real matrix was still queued, and
branch protection accepted it. A pull request merged to ``main`` that
way with no test run against its code (``CHANGELOG.md`` ignored,
``src/bernstein/core/planning/plan_loader.py`` and its test not).

No ``on:`` filter can express "every changed file is ignored", so the
stub decides in-job via ``scripts/ci_gate_stub_guard.py`` and takes its
check-run name from the verdict. Under any other verdict the check is
published under a name branch protection does not require.

Invariants exercised here:

1. The stub's emitting job resolves its ``name:`` from the guard verdict,
   and the ``CI gate`` branch of that expression is the one gated on
   "every changed path is ignored".
2. The emitting job is not gated with a verdict-dependent ``if:``.
   GitHub counts a *skipped* required check as passing, so an ``if:``
   skip would leave the hole open.
3. The guard reads its pattern list from ``ci.yml`` rather than a copy.
4. The guard returns "not all ignored" for every diff that contains a
   non-ignored path, including the exact diff that merged untested.
5. The guard still returns "all ignored" for the fully-ignored diffs the
   stub exists to unblock, so those pull requests keep merging.
