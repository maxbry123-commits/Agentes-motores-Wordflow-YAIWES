"""Contract fixture for foreign attestations outside Bernstein's own chain.

The fixture carries the foreign envelope opaquely, by reference: only a format
tag, a payload hash and an unreadable signature blob, so nothing below depends
on which attestation format an issuer happens to use.

It pins the negative case first.  When a foreign issuer cannot be independently
verified, a future verifier must report ``unverifiable``.  That verdict is
distinct from Bernstein's own verified lineage, and equally distinct from a
signature that was evaluated and rejected.  "We could not evaluate this" and
"we evaluated this and it failed" are different outcomes, and reporting the
second in place of the first states a verdict on work that was never performed.
