    The old implementation called ``self._path.open("r", ...)`` inside a
    generator expression and never closed the file: under tight append
    loops the leaked handles accumulated until the process hit
    ``OSError: Too many open files``. The fix reads the file inside a
    ``with`` block so each trim closes the FD on every code path.

    We approximate that on portable platforms by exercising trim many
    times and forcing garbage collection at the end; if the implementation
    is leaking, ``len(read())`` would still be correct but a future
    sanitiser run would flag the handle. The behavioural assertion below
    catches the more common failure mode where the trim path raised
    silently and left the buffer wedged past ``max_entries``.
