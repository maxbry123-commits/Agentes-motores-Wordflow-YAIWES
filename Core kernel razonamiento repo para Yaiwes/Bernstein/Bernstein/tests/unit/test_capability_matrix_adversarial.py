"""Adversarial verification of the lethal-trifecta capability matrix.

This module exists to *try to break* the structural rule that no spawned
agent may carry the union of all three capabilities (PRIVATE_DATA,
UNTRUSTED_INPUT, EXTERNAL_COMM) on a single execution path.  Each test
encodes a bypass vector - tool aliasing, capability mutation, runtime
scope escalation, surface mismatch, race-against-spawn - and asserts
that the matrix fails closed.

If any of these tests starts *passing the chain* without the matching
deny path, the lethal trifecta is reachable and a :class:`LethalTrifectaError`
must be raised by the production code or the regression is a security
incident.
