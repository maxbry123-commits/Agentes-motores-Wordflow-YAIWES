Split out of the former ``tests/unit/test_tenant_scope_http_isolation.py``.
That file built a fresh app per test across 137 tests; the per-test teardown
cost scales with the live heap, so the whole file ran ~200s locally and blew
past the runner's 300s per-file budget on the slower macOS host. The runner
budgets per *file* and gives each one its own subprocess, so three focused
