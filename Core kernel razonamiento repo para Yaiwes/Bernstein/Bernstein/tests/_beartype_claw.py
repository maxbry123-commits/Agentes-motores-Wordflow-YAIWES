"""Optional beartype import-hook activator.

Imported from the top-level conftest.py when ``BEARTYPE_USE_CLAW=enable``
is set in the environment. The hook installs a runtime type-checker on
the ``bernstein.core.security``, ``bernstein.core.cluster``, and
``bernstein.core.agents`` packages so ``@beartype``-decorated entry
points get full enforcement *and* every plain ``def f(x: int) -> str``
in those packages gets enforced too.

Why opt-in? Unconditional beartype across 300k+ LOC slows tests by
~15-25% on big suites. CI sets the env var explicitly on the
``beartype`` job; local runs default to off (no overhead).

Why not just decorate every function? Beartype's ``claws`` mode
auto-applies the decorator to every public function in a target
package without code changes - exactly what we need to catch type
errors that would otherwise only surface on the first production call.
