"""Property tests for the action-cache ``fingerprint`` primitive.

``fingerprint(fn, *args, **kwargs)`` is the cache-key generator for
the orchestrator's memoised function calls. Determinism here is
load-bearing: when ``PYTHONHASHSEED`` varies across workers, two
processes computing the same fingerprint must agree on the bytes, or
every cache lookup misses and the orchestrator's cost-saving
guarantees evaporate.

Properties:

* **Determinism across calls** - two calls with the same args / kwargs
  produce the same digest.

* **Order independence for kwargs** - kwargs are sorted; supplying
  them in any order produces the same digest.

* **Set / frozenset member-order independence** - the canonicaliser
  sorts set members by repr so processes with different hash seeds
  agree. Without this, action-cache hit rate plummets to ~0% across
  workers.

* **Distinct args → distinct digests** - at least for primitive
  scalars and obviously-different containers, the digest discriminates.
  A regression that collapses everything to the same digest would
  serve stale cached values to every caller.

* **Digest length is 32 bytes** - the ``_DIGEST_BYTES = 32`` invariant
  is part of the on-disk format; a change would corrupt every existing
  ``MemoStore`` entry.
