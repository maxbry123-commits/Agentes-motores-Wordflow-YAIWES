"""custom-guardrail - fail-closed no-secrets-in-prompt guardrail.

Worked example of the bernstein guardrail extension point. The plugin
contributes a :class:`Guardrail` implementation that scans incoming
prompts for canonical secret-shaped tokens and rejects the run when any
pattern matches.

The plugin registers itself via the ``bernstein.plugins`` entry-point
group; bernstein's plugin manager picks it up at startup and the
guardrail is appended to the default pipeline.
