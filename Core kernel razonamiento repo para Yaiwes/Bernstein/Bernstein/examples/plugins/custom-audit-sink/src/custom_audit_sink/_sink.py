"""MQTT audit-event sink (worked example).

The sink subscribes to bernstein's ``on_audit_event`` hookspec and
forwards each event as a single-line JSON blob to a configurable MQTT
topic. The broker connection itself is stubbed in this example -
replace :meth:`_publish` with a real client (e.g. ``paho.mqtt``) when
wiring this into your environment.

The plugin reads its configuration from environment variables so an
operator can drop the package into a CI image and toggle the sink
on/off without touching code:

* ``BERNSTEIN_AUDIT_MQTT_URL`` - broker URL (``mqtt://host:1883``).
* ``BERNSTEIN_AUDIT_MQTT_TOPIC`` - topic name (default ``bernstein/audit``).
* ``BERNSTEIN_AUDIT_MQTT_ENABLED`` - gate flag; the sink no-ops when unset.

The hook is registered with ``@hookspec(background=True)`` upstream so
the publish path runs off the main orchestrator tick - a slow broker
cannot block the orchestrator's main loop.
