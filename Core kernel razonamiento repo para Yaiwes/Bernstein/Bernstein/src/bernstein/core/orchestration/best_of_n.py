"""Recursive best-of-N delegation: spawn K candidates and pick the winner.

Implements the *recursive-best-of-N-delegation* agentic pattern.  For tasks
flagged with ``best_of_n=K`` (K in [2, 5]) the orchestrator spawns K
candidate workers in isolated worktrees, scores each candidate with
automated signals (tests passing, lint clean, runtime), optionally asks a
cheap-tier LLM judge for a rubric score, blends the two into a final
score, and keeps only the winner's diff.  Losing candidates' worktrees are
reclaimed.

Opt-in: callers must explicitly invoke :class:`BestOfNRunner`.  Tasks
opt in by setting ``Task.best_of_n=K``; tasks without that field run as a
single agent via the existing pipeline.  See
:data:`bernstein.core.defaults.BEST_OF_N` for the global enable flag.

Coexistence with :mod:`bernstein.core.orchestration.phase_pipeline`:
both patterns are independent - a task can be phased *or* fan-out, not
both at once (the runner only inspects ``best_of_n``).

    https://github.com/nibzard/awesome-agentic-patterns/blob/main/patterns/recursive-best-of-n-delegation.md
