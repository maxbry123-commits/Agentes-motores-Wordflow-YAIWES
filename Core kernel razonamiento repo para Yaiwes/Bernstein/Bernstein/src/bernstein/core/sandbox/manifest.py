"""WorkspaceManifest - declarative description of a sandbox workspace.

The manifest is the value object backends consume via
:meth:`SandboxBackend.create`. Phase 1 (oai-002) covered the minimum
surface every backend needs to materialise a workable checkout:
workspace root path, optional git clone source, byte-injected files,
and environment variables.

oai-003 extends the manifest with cloud-mount entries that describe
how spawned agents should see their artifact storage. When a non-local
sandbox backend is selected together with a remote
:class:`~bernstein.core.storage.sink.ArtifactSink`, the sandbox
translates each mount into the provider-specific filesystem binding
(``rclone mount`` inside the container for S3, ``gcsfuse`` for GCS,
etc.) so agent writes to the mount path stream directly to the
orchestrator's artifact store. The local-worktree backend ignores the
mount entries because everything already lives on the host filesystem.

A manifest is frozen once passed to :meth:`SandboxBackend.create`: the
dataclasses are immutable and any nested tuple is read-only. Backends
treat it as a pure value object.
