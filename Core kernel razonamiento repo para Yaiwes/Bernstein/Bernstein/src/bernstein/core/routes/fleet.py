"""Fleet aggregator stub for the operator UI.

The Bernstein fleet dashboard (``bernstein fleet --web``) is a separate
FastAPI application served on its own port - see
:mod:`bernstein.core.fleet.web`. The operator UI ("/ui") talks to the
*single-project* task server, which historically had no fleet endpoints.

This router adds the minimal fleet surface the SPA needs in order to ship
the Fleet-mode toggle without depending on the side-car app being
running. It is intentionally a stub:

    * When the host orchestrator process is running a fleet aggregator
      (``request.app.state.fleet_aggregator``), the stub delegates to it
      and returns real ``ProjectSnapshot`` rows.
    * Otherwise it returns an empty list with ``stub=True`` and a hint
      pointing operators at ``bernstein fleet --web`` so the frontend
      can wire itself end-to-end without a populated fleet.

The endpoints intentionally mirror :mod:`bernstein.core.fleet.web` shape
so a future merge can drop the stub for the real aggregator without any
client-side change.
