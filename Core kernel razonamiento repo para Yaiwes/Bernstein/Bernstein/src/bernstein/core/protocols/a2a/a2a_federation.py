"""MCP-009: A2A protocol federation.

Exchange tasks with external orchestrators via A2A protocol. Builds on
the existing :mod:`bernstein.core.a2a` module to add:

- Peer registry for known external orchestrators.
- Outbound task delegation (send a task to an external peer over HTTP).
- Inbound task acceptance (receive and track federated tasks).
- Status synchronisation between local and remote task states.

Wire transport
--------------
``delegate_task_http`` performs a real HTTP POST to the peer's
``/a2a/v0/tasks`` endpoint, with retry on 5xx and connection errors,
and updates the local ledger transactionally:

* on success → ``mark_sent`` is called and the peer's ``last_seen`` /
  ``state`` are refreshed to ``ACTIVE``;
* on final failure → the federated task is moved to ``FAILED`` and the
  peer transitions to ``UNREACHABLE``; an :class:`A2ADelegationError`
  is raised so the caller can react.

The in-memory ledger is still authoritative for local state - HTTP is
only the wire transport. Synchronous :meth:`delegate_task` is preserved
for bookkeeping-only use cases (tests, dry runs, planning) and remains
the path used by all 25 existing unit tests.

Usage::

    from bernstein.core.protocols.a2a_federation import A2AFederation

    fed = A2AFederation(local_endpoint="http://orchestrator:8052")
    fed.register_peer("design-team", "http://design.local:8052")
    task = await fed.delegate_task_http(
        "design-team",
        "Create wireframes for login page",
