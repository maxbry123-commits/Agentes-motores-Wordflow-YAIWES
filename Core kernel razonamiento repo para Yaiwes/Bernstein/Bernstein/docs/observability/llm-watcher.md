# Opt-in LLM watcher

The LLM watcher is a side-channel observer that reads the
deterministic loop's events and annotates them with a natural-language
summary. The default model is Anthropic's Haiku. The watcher is
**off by default**; it sits at the top of Bernstein's three-layer
architecture (deterministic orchestrator below, immutable HMAC
chain in the middle, LLM observer above).

## Why it exists

The orchestrator emits a structured event stream every tick: plan
decisions, task spawns, task completions, merge decisions. Reading
that stream raw is feasible for a developer and tedious for an
on-call human. The watcher converts the stream into short
human-readable suggestions: "task T-12 has spawned 4 times with the
same failing fixture, consider escalating", "budget burned 80% in
the first 20 minutes, expect throttling soon".

The watcher is structurally read-only by design:

- The public `observe` API only accepts an immutable, frozen
  `WatcherEvent` snapshot. It receives no orchestrator handle, no
  task store, no agent spawner, no filesystem path.
- The return type is `list[Suggestion]` - pure advisory data.
  Suggestions are never auto-applied. The orchestrator decides
  whether to log, surface, or persist them.
- Failures inside the watcher (LLM adapter exceptions, timeout,
  network) are caught and converted into an empty signal list. A
  misbehaving watcher cannot crash the orchestrator.

## How to enable it

The watcher is disabled by default. The orchestrator emits zero
events and makes zero LLM calls until it is opted in.

```bash
# Enable for the next run
export BERNSTEIN_LLM_WATCHER_ENABLED=1

# Optional: pin a different observer model
export BERNSTEIN_LLM_WATCHER_MODEL=haiku
export BERNSTEIN_LLM_WATCHER_PROVIDER=claude

bernstein run plan.yaml
```

The default observer model is Haiku via the existing Claude
adapter. The model name resolves through the same alias map as the
rest of the orchestrator, so `haiku`, `claude-haiku`, or any
operator-defined alias work.

## What it observes

The watcher subscribes to four event kinds:

| Event | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `plan_decided` | The orchestrator commits a plan for the run. |
| `task_spawned` | A task is claimed and an agent is launched. |
| `task_completed` | A task finishes (success or failure). |
| `merge_decided` | The merge queue selects an outcome for a task. |

Each event is delivered as a frozen `WatcherEvent` carrying the
event kind, the run ID, a timestamp, and a sanitised payload. The
payload is a JSON-serialisable dict; callers must not put callable
objects, file handles, or references to orchestrator-internal
mutable state into the payload.

## Suggestions

The watcher returns a list of `Suggestion` records:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `suggestion_id` | Stable identifier for cross-referencing in logs. |
| `run_id` | Run that the originating event belonged to. |
| `detector` | Free-form detector name. The first slice emits a generic `observer` detector. |
| `severity` | `info`, `warning`, or `critical`. |
| `rationale` | Short human-readable explanation. |
| `proposed_action` | Suggested next step (informational only - never executed automatically). |
| `cost_usd` | Estimated USD cost of the LLM call that produced this suggestion. |

## Configuration

| Env var | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `BERNSTEIN_LLM_WATCHER_ENABLED` | `0` | Master switch. Watcher emits nothing unless set to a truthy value (`1`, `true`, `yes`, `on`). |
| `BERNSTEIN_LLM_WATCHER_MODEL` | `haiku` | Observer model alias. |
| `BERNSTEIN_LLM_WATCHER_PROVIDER` | `claude` | Provider for the observer model. |

## Limitations

- The first slice ships the plumbing and a generic `observer`
  detector. Detector packs (`stuck_loop`, `plan_drift`,
  `budget_overrun`, `failure_recurrence`, `jailbreak_shape`) and
  the suggestion-review CLI live in follow-up slices.
- The watcher cannot mutate orchestrator state by construction.
  Suggestions are advisory until a human or a future review
  CLI acts on them.
- Cost is bounded by the per-event LLM call; a runaway observer
  is bounded by the per-run cost cap (see
  [Cost optimisation](../operations/cost-optimization.md)).
