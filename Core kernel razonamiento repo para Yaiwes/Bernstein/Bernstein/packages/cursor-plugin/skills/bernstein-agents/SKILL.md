# Bernstein Agent Management

Inspect, monitor, and control active Bernstein agents.

## When to Use

- User asks "what agents are running?" or "show me the agents"
- User wants to see what a specific agent is working on
- User says "kill that agent" or "stop the backend agent"
- User asks "why is that agent stuck?" or wants to inspect agent output
- User wants to see agent logs

## Instructions

### List agents

1. Run `scripts/agents.sh list` to get all active agents.
2. Present them clearly:

```
## Active Agents (3)

| Agent | Role | Model | Status | Task | Runtime | Cost |
|-------|------|-------|--------|------|---------|------|
| ses-a1b2 | backend | claude-sonnet-4 | alive | TASK-042: Fix auth | 4m 12s | $0.32 |
| ses-c3d4 | qa | gpt-4.1 | alive | TASK-043: Write tests | 2m 45s | $0.18 |
| ses-e5f6 | frontend | claude-sonnet-4 | stalled | TASK-044: Update UI | 8m 03s | $0.51 |
```

### Inspect agent

3. To see what an agent is doing: `scripts/agents.sh logs <session_id>`
4. Show the last ~20 lines of output.

### Kill agent

5. To kill a stalled or misbehaving agent: `scripts/agents.sh kill <session_id>`
6. Confirm: "Agent ses-e5f6 terminated. Task TASK-044 returned to open queue."

### Stall detection

7. If any agent shows `stalled` status, proactively suggest killing it.
8. An agent is stalled if it hasn't sent a heartbeat in >60 seconds.
