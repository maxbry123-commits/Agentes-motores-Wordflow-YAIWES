//! Per-phase timing breakdown for [`Client::start`](crate::Client::start).
//!
//! `Client::start` performs several sequential phases between "spawn the CLI"
//! and "client is ready to create sessions": resolving (and possibly
//! extracting) the CLI binary, spawning the subprocess, waiting for the TCP
//! port announcement, the `connect` protocol handshake, and the optional
//! `sessionFs.setProvider` / `llmInference.setProvider` registration RPCs.
//!
//! Each phase is already measured internally with an [`Instant`] and logged at
//! `debug`. [`StartupTimings`] aggregates those durations into a single value
//! so a host can attribute total startup latency ("time to first token"
//! groundwork) to a specific phase — e.g. separating "process exec cost" from
//! "handshake/negotiation cost" — instead of reconstructing it from scattered
//! log lines.
//!
//! Retrieve it after start via
//! [`Client::startup_timings`](crate::Client::startup_timings).
//!
//! [`Instant`]: std::time::Instant
