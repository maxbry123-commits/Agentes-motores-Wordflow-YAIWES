/**
 * Session event "session.managed_settings_resolved". Enterprise managed-settings resolution: the effective managed settings the session applied and which channels contributed, so SDK clients can show users what is enterprise-managed. Fires whenever managed policy is (re)applied — at session start, on resume, and on account switch. This is an ephemeral live snapshot (delivered to subscribers but not persisted to the session event log), because at session start it resolves before `session.start` is emitted. Device values take precedence over server values per ordinary key, while permissions compose restrictively across device, server, and SDK-client layers. The account-scoped `getManagedSettings()` API does not include session-local client injection. Marked experimental while the managed-settings surface stabilizes.
 * @since 1.0.0
