"""Example 7 — Route to specialist Agents.

Pattern: classify the user's question, then dispatch to a
specialist Agent. The classifier is a tiny model (cheap +
deterministic routing); the specialists are full models (the part
where reasoning matters).

The DEVELOPER controls the routing — the classifier just produces
a label, and a Python dict says which Agent handles each label.
The LLM only does the work each step asks of it; it doesn't
decide control flow.

This is the most common production shape: "trustworthy skeleton
with smart leaves."

Run::

    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... python examples/07_workflow_route.py
