"""ReAct: the canonical observe-think-act loop.

Each turn:

1. Check budget; emit warning / exceeded.
2. Call the model with current messages + available tools.
3. Stream tokens, accumulate text + tool calls + usage.
4. If no tool calls, the model is done; break.
5. Otherwise, dispatch all tool calls in parallel through hooks
   → permissions → tool host. Append results to messages.
6. Loop.

This is the v0.1.x default behaviour, lifted verbatim out of
``Agent._loop`` and behind the :class:`Architecture` protocol.
Behaviour is identical; the refactor only changes the shape.
