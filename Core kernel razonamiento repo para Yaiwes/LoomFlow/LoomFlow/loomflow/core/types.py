      (OpenAI). Best for first-time-correctness reviewers.
    * ``True`` → ``PromptCacheConfig(enabled=True)`` with 5-minute
      TTL. Anthropic adapters will inject ``cache_control`` on the
      system prompt + tool definitions; OpenAI adapters will parse
      ``cached_tokens`` from the response and apply the discount.
    * ``dict`` → explicit per-field config:

    Provider mapping:

    * **OpenAI** — caching is automatic regardless of this flag, but
      ``cache_key`` (when set) forwards as ``prompt_cache_key`` for
      improved cache-hit routing. Read tokens are billed at 0.5x.
    * **Anthropic** — ``cache_control: {type: "ephemeral", ttl}``
      injected on the LAST system block + the LAST tool definition
      (2 of the 4 available breakpoints). Read tokens billed at
      0.1x; write tokens at 1.25x (5m) or 2x (1h).
    * **DeepSeek / OpenAI-compatible gateways** — caching is
      automatic server-side; ``cache_key`` is the only wire-visible
      knob (forwarded as ``prompt_cache_key``). On failover gateways
      that spread requests across upstream hosts, setting it is
      **required** for hits — it pins consecutive requests to one
      host so the prefix cache gets a second look. Hit counts are
      read from ``prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens`` with a
      fallback to DeepSeek's native ``prompt_cache_hit_tokens``.
      ``ttl`` is ignored on this path.

class RunResult(BaseModel):

    Three accessors for the model's output, picked by what fits
    the call site:

    * ``result.value`` — **recommended for most code**. Smart
      accessor: returns the parsed Pydantic instance when an
      ``output_schema`` was supplied AND validation succeeded;
      falls through to the raw text otherwise. One name, right
      type, no surprise on the schema vs no-schema split.
    * ``result.parsed`` — explicit "give me the typed object or
      ``None``". Only populated when ``output_schema=`` was set
      and the model produced something that validated.
    * ``result.output`` — always a string. The raw text the model
      emitted (the JSON itself when a schema was supplied). Use
      for logging, audit, debugging — when you want to see what
      the model actually said, not the parsed view.
