"""Local-disk :class:`Workspace` backend.

Layout per user_id partition (anonymous bucket is the empty string)::

    <root>/<user_id>/
        WORKSPACE.md            ← auto-regenerated index
        seeds/                  ← read-only user-provided refs (optional)
        notes/<author>/<slug>.md
        .loom/audit.jsonl       ← reserved for future audit hook

Slugs are ``<NNN>-<slugified-title>`` where ``NNN`` is a per-author
zero-padded counter that survives across writes within the same run.
Counters live on disk (in the existing file count) so cross-run
reuse keeps numbering monotonic.

Write atomicity:

* Note files are written to a temp file in the same dir and
  ``Path.replace()``'d into place — atomic on POSIX, mostly atomic
  on Windows.
* ``WORKSPACE.md`` is regenerated after every write using the same
  temp-file + replace pattern.

An ``anyio.Lock`` serialises index regeneration AND the
slug-counter-computation + file-creation step of ``write_note`` —
without the latter, two concurrent writes by the same author could
pick the same counter and silently clobber each other. Per-author
counters and parsed notes are cached in memory (keyed by
``(mtime_ns, size)``) so repeated reads / writes don't re-walk and
re-parse the whole tree.

Text encoding is FORCED to UTF-8 on every read and write. The
``Path.read_text`` / ``write_text`` defaults pick up the system
locale codec — on Windows that's ``cp1252`` ("charmap"), which
can't encode many of the Unicode characters models like to emit
(``≥``, em-dashes, smart quotes, ...). Forcing UTF-8 here means
the same notebook works identically across Windows, macOS, and
Linux hosts, and notebooks created on one platform are readable
on another.
