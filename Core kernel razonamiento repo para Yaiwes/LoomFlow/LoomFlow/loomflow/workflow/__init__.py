"""Workflow — developer-controlled step graphs (directed, cycles
allowed with visit caps).

Loom ships **two peer primitives** for building LLM systems:

* :class:`~loomflow.Agent` — the LLM controls the loop. Open-ended
  reasoning, dynamic tool selection, ReAct-style think/act/observe.
* :class:`Workflow` (this module) — *the developer* controls the
  graph. Predictable steps, deterministic branching, audit-friendly.

Picking between them is an engineering decision, not a stylistic one
(see ``docs/workflow_vs_agent.md``). Production systems usually need
both, composed together. This module is the answer to "I have parts
of both."

Three ways to use it, ordered by ceremony:

1. **Plain Python with ``@step``.** Decorate any ``async def`` and
   it picks up telemetry + audit + (optional) journal hooks
   automatically. Control flow stays as ``if/await/return``::

       @step
       async def classify(text: str) -> str: ...

       @step
       async def respond(text: str, label: str) -> str: ...

       async def my_workflow(text: str, user_id: str) -> str:
           label = await classify(text)
           return await respond(text, label)

2. **Sugar constructors for common shapes.** No graph builder
   needed; one call makes a fully wired Workflow::

       wf = Workflow.chain([classify, respond])
       wf = Workflow.route(classifier, {"a": fn_a, "b": fn_b})
       wf = Workflow.parallel([fn_a, fn_b, fn_c], merge=combine)

3. **Explicit graph builder.** For cases where the graph IS the
   artifact (compliance flows, BPMN-like approval chains)::

       wf = Workflow("triage")
       wf.add_node("classify", classify)
       wf.add_node("billing", billing_agent)
       wf.add_node("tech", tech_agent)
       wf.set_start("classify")
       wf.add_router("classify", lambda r: r.lower(),
                     {"billing": "billing", "tech": "tech"})
       wf.add_edge("billing", END)
       wf.add_edge("tech", END)

Composition with :class:`~loomflow.Agent`:

* **Agent inside a Workflow.** Pass an ``Agent`` instance as a node;
  the framework calls ``.run(input)`` automatically and threads the
  live :class:`~loomflow.RunContext` (user_id / session_id /
  metadata) through to the inner agent run.
* **Workflow inside an Agent.** Call ``wf.as_tool()`` to get a
  :class:`~loomflow.Tool` that an Agent can invoke. The whole
  workflow runs as one tool call from the agent's perspective.

Both directions reuse the same observability spine — telemetry
spans, audit-log entries, ``user_id`` partition. A trace shows
exactly which decisions were workflow-deterministic and which
were LLM-driven, tagged via the ``pattern`` span attribute.

    Not strictly a DAG — cycles are first-class (feedback /
    refinement loops), bounded by the ``max_steps`` and
    ``max_visits_per_node`` safety caps.

    Which primitive when:

    * **Deterministic routing / fixed steps** (the developer
      decides the control flow) → this class. ``Workflow.route``
      covers classify-then-dispatch with *your* classifier
      function.
    * **LLM-driven routing to one specialist** →
      :meth:`loomflow.Team.router` (Router architecture).
    * **LLM-driven delegation across many agents** →
      :meth:`loomflow.Team.supervisor` and friends, or
      ``Agent(architecture=...)``.
    * **Drawing a picture of an agent tree** → ``loomflow.graph``
      (visualization only — it never executes anything).

    Construct with the explicit graph builder (``add_node`` /
    ``add_edge`` / ``set_start``) for full control, or use one of
    the sugar classmethods for common shapes:

    * :meth:`chain` — linear sequence
    * :meth:`route` — classify, then dispatch
    * :meth:`parallel` — fan out, run, merge

    Run with :meth:`run` (collects everything, returns a
    :class:`WorkflowResult`) or :meth:`stream` (yields
    :class:`~loomflow.Event` per step).

    **Parallel scheduling — fan-out and joins.** Execution is
    readiness-based: a node runs as soon as its inputs are complete,
    so independent branches run concurrently (bounded by
    ``max_concurrency``). The data-flow contract:

    * Calling :meth:`add_edge` more than once from the same source
      **fans out** — every target receives the source's output and
      the branches run concurrently.
    * A router (:meth:`add_router`) still picks exactly **one**
      branch per evaluation; untaken branches never run.
    * A node with several in-edges is an **AND-join**: it waits
      until no in-flight (or upstream-pending) node can still
      deliver to it, then runs once. With a single delivered input
      it receives the bare value — exactly the sequential model,
      so router merge points behave as before. With two or more
      delivered inputs it receives a ``list`` of the values ordered
      by edge **declaration** order (the same list contract as
      :meth:`parallel`'s ``merge``), not by completion order.
    * Cycles stay first-class. ``max_steps`` /
      ``max_visits_per_node`` are enforced globally by a single
      scheduler task that owns all counters, so the caps are
      race-free under concurrency. Join buffering is per wave: on a
      later loop iteration where only one in-edge delivers, the
      join receives that bare value.
    * A failing node cancels in-flight siblings and fails the run
      with the original exception.

    Purely sequential graphs (chains, routers) execute exactly as
    they did under the sequential walker — same events, same order.

    Compose with :class:`~loomflow.Agent`:

    * **Agent as a step** — pass an ``Agent`` instance to
      :meth:`add_node`; the framework calls ``.run`` and threads
      the live :class:`RunContext` through.
    * **Workflow as a tool** — call :meth:`as_tool` to get a
      :class:`Tool` an Agent can invoke.

    Both share the framework's observability spine: ``user_id`` is
    forwarded to nested agent runs, telemetry spans nest correctly,
    audit-log entries carry per-step attribution.
