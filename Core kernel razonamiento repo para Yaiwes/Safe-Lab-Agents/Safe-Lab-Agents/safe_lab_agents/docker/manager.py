    The workspace/shared dirs are created here on the host, so they're owned by
    the host user.  On Linux a bind mount shares the host inode verbatim, and the
    in-container ``agent`` user's UID essentially never matches the host owner:

    * rootful Docker / Podman — files show up owned by the host UID, not
      ``agent``;
    * rootless Podman — the host user maps to *container-root*, so they show up
      **root-owned** inside the container.

    Either way ``agent`` falls into the "other" permission class and cannot write
    with the default ``0775``/``0644``.  We widen dirs to ``0777`` and files to
    add ``rw`` for everyone, *without* changing ownership — so the host side
    (e.g. the auto-log writer, which runs as the host user) keeps its own access.
    The mode bit is metadata on the shared inode, so the container sees it
    immediately; no in-container privilege juggling required.  (On macOS /
    Windows the mounts go through a VM file-sharing layer that already fakes
    ownership, so this is a harmless no-op there.)

    Applied recursively so pre-existing content (seeded data, files left by an
    earlier session) becomes writable too.  Best-effort: files owned by another
    user that the host can't chmod (e.g. left by a session under a *different*
    container runtime, owned by a Podman subuid) are skipped rather than aborting
    the whole session.  This is logged at ``debug`` rather than ``warning``: the
    common trigger is a *resume* under rootless Podman, where a file the prior
    container's ``agent`` user wrote is owned by that agent's subuid — which the
    resumed container maps back to the same ``agent`` user, so it already owns and
    can write the file regardless of its host-side mode.  In that (benign) case
    the failed chmod is a no-op, so surfacing it as a warning was pure noise.
    A genuinely stuck file (owned by a *different* runtime's subuid) is still
    skipped here and would surface downstream as an in-container write error.
