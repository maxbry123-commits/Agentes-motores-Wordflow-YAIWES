    The function is pure and deterministic: the same call always returns the
    same structure, with no network access and no LLM. The structure is
    JSON-serialisable so the CLI can emit it verbatim.

    Returns:
        A dict with the version, the four mandated sections (``when_to_call``,
        ``when_not_to_call``, ``required_flow``, ``evidence_rule``), the
        deterministic ``decision_to_control`` mapping, and a short set of
        ``invariants`` an integration must uphold.
