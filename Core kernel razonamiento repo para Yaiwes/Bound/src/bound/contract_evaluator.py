class ContractEvaluator:

    Unlike the :class:`~bound.evaluator.Evaluator` Protocol (which scores a
    proposed :class:`~bound.models.Action`), this evaluator scores an *executed*
    step by reconciling collected :class:`~bound.evidence.ExecutionEvidence`
    against the declared :class:`~bound.contracts.StepContract`. The computation
    is pure: same contract + evidence → same scores, with no network or model
    dependency.

    All mappings are **v0.3 reference heuristics** — not scientifically
    calibrated:

    * **Acceptance (A)** ``∈ [0, 1]``: ``A = passed_required /
      total_required``, where each required :class:`~bound.contracts.AcceptanceCheck`
      is reconciled against :class:`~bound.evidence.CheckEvidence` by ``id``. A
      required check with **no** matching evidence counts as **FAILED** (never
      silently passing). Duplicate evidence for one ``id`` is deduplicated
      conservatively: the check passes only when *every* matching record has
      ``passed=True``. Optional (``required=False``) checks are recorded as
      advisory provenance only and do **not** affect ``A``. When the contract
      defines no required checks at all, ``A = 0.0`` (acceptance cannot be
      established from advisory checks alone).
    * **Cost (C)** ``∈ [0, 1]``: the mean of the *available* budget dimensions.
      Each declared dimension is ``min(actual / max, 1.0)`` (with the cap-zero
      rule from :func:`_normalize_capped`): ``retry_cost``, ``tool_cost``,
      ``token_cost``, ``runtime_cost``. A dimension is available when its budget
      maximum is defined. When a declared budget dimension's telemetry is
      unmeasured (``token_usage`` / ``runtime_seconds`` is ``None``) it is
      conservatively saturated to :data:`_UNMEASURED_COST_SATURATION` because
      budget compliance cannot be confirmed. When ``contract.budget`` is
      ``None``, ``C = 0.0`` and the provenance records "no cost budget was
      defined." When a budget exists but no dimension is defined, ``C = 0.0``.
    * **Risk (R)** ``∈ [0, 1]``: ``R = min(1.0, Σ contributions)`` — additive
      and capped, so a single failed check makes risk "rise by its severity".
      Each declared :class:`~bound.contracts.RiskCheck` contributes its
      ``severity`` when violated (evidence shows ``passed=False``, or —
      conservatively — when there is **no** matching evidence, because BOUND
      cannot confirm the risk was avoided), and ``0.0`` when confirmed passed.
      Two observable safety signals are added on top: ``unexpected_artifacts``
      non-empty contributes :data:`_UNEXPECTED_ARTIFACT_INDICATOR`;
      ``rollback_available is False`` contributes
      :data:`_ROLLBACK_UNAVAILABLE_INDICATOR`. ``rollback_available is None`` (a
      pure observable the contract does not declare) is *skipped* rather than
      invented.
    * **Influence (I)** ``∈ [-1, 1]``: ``0.0`` by default with an explicit
      honesty note, because no downstream-influence evidence is derivable from
      contract evidence. A caller may instead supply influence externally at
      construction. Honesty is preferred over invented sophistication.

        :attr:`decision_critical <bound.contracts.RiskCheck.decision_critical>`
        or provenance-restricted. Unrestricted checks never degrade assurance.

        Assurance level (worst contributor wins, priority order):

        * **INSUFFICIENT** — a restricted check has no evidence, INVALID
          evidence, or a provenance outside its ``accepted_provenance``.
        * **CLAIMED** — a restricted check leans on CLAIMED (agent self-report).
        * **MIXED** — every restricted check has acceptable evidence but some is

        * **VERIFIED** — every restricted check's evidence is verified-tier
          (OBSERVED/VERIFIED/ATTETSTED). With no restricted checks, VERIFIED.

        When assurance is CLAIMED or INSUFFICIENT, a candidate ACCEPT is blocked:
