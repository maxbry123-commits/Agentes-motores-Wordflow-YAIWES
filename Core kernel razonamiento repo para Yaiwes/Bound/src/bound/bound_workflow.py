    The workflow wires three deterministic components — a
    :class:`~bound.contracts.ContractGenerator`, a
    :class:`~bound.contract_evaluator.ContractEvaluator`, and a
    :class:`~bound.policy.BoundPolicy` — behind two operations:
    :meth:`prepare` (goal + plan -> validated
    :class:`~bound.contracts.BoundPlan`) and :meth:`evaluate_step` (one executed
    step -> :class:`~bound.models.EvaluationResult` whose decision comes from
    the :class:`~bound.policy.BoundPolicy`). It is intentionally thin: no agent
    loop, no execution control, no decision rule. The consuming agent decides
    when to prepare, when to evaluate, and how to react to
    ACCEPT / RETRY / REPLAN / ROLLBACK.

    Attributes:
        contract_generator: The :class:`~bound.contracts.ContractGenerator`
            used by :meth:`prepare`, or ``None`` when the workflow was

        evaluator: The :class:`~bound.contract_evaluator.ContractEvaluator`
            used to score an executed step against its contract.
        policy: The :class:`~bound.policy.BoundPolicy` that owns the final
            ACCEPT / RETRY / REPLAN / ROLLBACK decision.

        The pipeline is ``StepContract + ExecutionEvidence -> ContractEvaluator
        -> EvaluationScores (A / I / R / C) -> BoundPolicy.decide ->
        EvaluationResult (ACCEPT / RETRY / REPLAN / ROLLBACK)``. The contract
        scores come from the bound
        :class:`~bound.contract_evaluator.ContractEvaluator` (the single
        deterministic source, which also exposes per-dimension ``provenance``);
        the decision comes from the bound
        :class:`~bound.policy.BoundPolicy` — never from the workflow. The scores
        are fed straight into :meth:`~bound.policy.BoundPolicy.decide`, the
        single place where ``calculate_components`` and the decision rule run,
        so the contract is never re-scored and no placeholder evaluator is
        involved. See the module docstring for the full rationale.

        When an active ``policy`` is supplied it governs the
        evaluation: its weighted quality signals feed the acceptance dimension,
        and its hard gates / budgets are assessed into a
        :class:`~bound.contract_evaluator.PolicyGateOutcome` passed to
        :meth:`~bound.policy.BoundPolicy.decide`, which forces an uncompensable
        decision when a blocker fails or a budget is breached. The active
        policy's id/version/hash and the resolved effective weights are recorded
        on the result for the trace. When ``policy`` is ``None`` (the default)
        the call is identical to the contract-only path — fully backwards
        compatible.

        When a ``run`` context is supplied (and lineage is enabled) the
        step's full lineage — ``step_started`` + ``evaluation_recorded`` +
        ``outcome_recorded`` — is written automatically by
        :func:`bound.lineage_api.record_step_evaluation`, deriving the control
        action and reason codes from the deterministic decision. This is a
        side effect only: the return type and value are unchanged. When no
        ``run`` is supplied (and the evaluator carries no
        :attr:`~bound.contract_evaluator.ContractEvaluator.lineage_run`) the
        call is completely backwards compatible — no lineage is written.

        Args:
            contract: The :class:`~bound.contracts.StepContract` whose declared
                acceptance checks, risk checks, and budget scope the scoring.
            evidence: The :class:`~bound.evidence.ExecutionEvidence` observed
                after the step executed.
            criteria: The :class:`~bound.models.BoundCriteria` (threshold,
                weights, retry margin, rollback risk boundary) the policy
                evaluates against.
            policy: Optional active :class:`~bound.policy_schema.BoundPolicyConfig`
                governing gates/weights/budgets for this step. ``None`` (the
                default) selects the contract-only path (backwards compatible).
            run: Optional :class:`~bound.lineage_api.RunContext`; when supplied
                (and enabled) the step's lineage is recorded automatically.
                Defaults to the evaluator's configured ``lineage_run`` when
                omitted, or ``None`` (no lineage) when neither is set.
            attempt: One-based attempt number recorded in lineage (default 1).
            step_id: Optional explicit step id for lineage; otherwise derived.
            description: Optional step description for lineage; defaults to the
                contract's description.

        Returns:
            An :class:`~bound.models.EvaluationResult` carrying the contract
            scores, weighted components, final score, threshold metadata, the
            deterministic decision, and the
            :class:`~bound.contract_evaluator.ContractEvaluator`'s provenance.
            When an active policy governed the step, the result also carries
            the effective weights and the active-policy id/version/hash.
