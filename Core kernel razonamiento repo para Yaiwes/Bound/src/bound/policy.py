class BoundPolicy:
    """Deterministic BOUND decision policy.

    The policy is intentionally evaluator-agnostic: any object satisfying the
    :class:`~bound.evaluator.Evaluator` Protocol can be injected, and the
    decision rule below is applied identically regardless of the source of
    scores. The evaluator (when present) supplies scores only; this class owns
    the decision via :meth:`decide`, the single assembly point for
    :class:`~bound.models.EvaluationResult`. The contract workflow feeds
    pre-computed :class:`~bound.models.EvaluationScores` from a
    :class:`~bound.contract_evaluator.ContractEvaluator` straight into
    :meth:`decide`, so it never needs (and never mutates) an injected
    evaluator — ``BoundPolicy()`` is a valid, placeholder-free construction for
    that path.

    Decision rule (applied exactly, in order):

    * ``scores.risk >= rollback_risk_threshold`` → ``ROLLBACK`` (safety
      boundary, evaluated first; a high-scoring but unsafe action still
      rolls back).
    * ``score >= threshold`` → ``ACCEPT`` (boundary-inclusive:
      ``S == T`` accepts).
    * ``gap = threshold - score`` and ``gap <= retry_margin`` → ``RETRY``
      (the action is close enough to the threshold to justify another
      attempt within the same action space).
    * otherwise → ``REPLAN`` (the action is too far below the threshold;
      choose a materially different strategy).

    This replaces the v0.1 ``risk > cost`` / ``cost > risk`` / ``risk == cost``
    rule entirely. In particular ``REPLAN`` is no longer gated on exact float
    equality of ``risk`` and ``cost``: it is simply the fall-through when the
    score is too far below the threshold to retry.

    Attributes:
        evaluator: The :class:`~bound.evaluator.Evaluator` used to score each
            :class:`Action` in the Action-based :meth:`evaluate` path, or
            ``None`` when the policy was constructed without one (the contract
            workflow uses :meth:`decide` instead).

        came from.

        v0.7 decision assurance: when an ``assurance_assessment`` is supplied
        (the contract workflow passes the
        :class:`~bound.contract_evaluator.ContractEvaluator`'s assessment), the
        result carries the *candidate* decision (the raw score-based one, also

        compatibility) and the *final* gated decision. A candidate ACCEPT whose
        assurance is :attr:`CLAIMED <DecisionAssurance.CLAIMED>` or
        :attr:`INSUFFICIENT <DecisionAssurance.INSUFFICIENT>` is downgraded to
        the contract's ``on_missing``/``on_claimed`` action (mapped to a BOUND
        decision); VERIFIED and MIXED leave the candidate unchanged.

        v0.7 active-policy gate: when a ``policy_gate`` is supplied (the
        contract workflow passes the
        :class:`~bound.contract_evaluator.ContractEvaluator`'s gate outcome for
        an active :class:`~bound.policy_schema.BoundPolicyConfig`), any forced
        action from a failed blocker or breached budget is applied on top of
        the (already assurance-gated) decision — taking the *most
        conservative* of the candidate and the forced action, so a blocker can
        never be compensated by a positive score. The resolved effective
        weights and the active policy id/version/hash are forwarded onto the
        result for the trace. When no assessment *and* no gate are supplied
        (the Action-based path, or a policy used without provenance-aware
        evidence) the candidate/final/assurance/trace fields stay
        ``None``/empty and ``decision`` is the sole outcome — fully backwards
        compatible.

                ``T``, ``retry_margin``, and ``rollback_risk_threshold``.
            provenance: Optional per-dimension evidence backing ``scores``.
                When supplied it is forwarded onto the result verbatim so a
                consumer can answer "why A / I / R / C?". Defaults to ``None``.
            assurance_assessment: Optional :class:`AssuranceAssessment` from a
                :class:`~bound.contract_evaluator.ContractEvaluator`. When
                supplied, candidate/final decisions and the assurance level +
                reasons are populated and a candidate ACCEPT may be gated.
                Defaults to ``None`` (no assurance gating).
            policy_gate: Optional :class:`PolicyGateOutcome` from an active
                :class:`~bound.policy_schema.BoundPolicyConfig`. When supplied, a
                failed blocker or breached budget forces the most conservative
