#: :class:`RunConfigSnapshot` on ``run_started`` (item 11), and append-only
#: event types — the schema-1.0 core (``run_started`` / ``step_started`` /

#: schema-2.0 additions: ``evidence.collected``, ``evidence.collection_failed``,
#: ``decision.gated``, ``action.reported`` (item 10/12), and the todo 7.1
#: policy-lifecycle + lifecycle-completion events ``policy.proposed`` /
#: ``policy.validated`` / ``policy.approved`` / ``policy.activated``,
#: ``evaluation.completed``, ``action.observed``, ``step.completed``.

#: names (schema 2.0) add the policy lifecycle, independent evidence collection,
#: assurance gating, and the agent's claimed/observed action report.
#:
#: Schema 2.0 additions (todo 7.1): ``policy.proposed`` / ``policy.validated``
#: / ``policy.approved`` / ``policy.activated`` record the policy lifecycle;
#: ``evaluation.completed`` marks a finished evaluation (distinct from
#: ``evaluation_recorded`` which records the calculation); ``action.observed``
#: records an independent hook's observation of the agent's action (complements
#: ``action.reported`` which is CLAIMED); ``step.completed`` marks a finished
