    the threshold ``T``, the signed distance to the threshold, the risk, the
    rollback risk threshold, and the decision. It is kept under
    :data:`MAX_WORDS` words.

    The per-decision wording follows the v0.2 semantics: ``ACCEPT`` is a
    boundary-inclusive satisficing signal (further optimization not required),
    ``RETRY`` asks for one focused attempt within the same approach,
    ``REPLAN`` calls for a different strategy, and ``ROLLBACK`` warns that the
    risk boundary has been exceeded.
