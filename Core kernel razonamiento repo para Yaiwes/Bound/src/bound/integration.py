    (``continue`` / ``retry`` / ``replan`` / ``rollback``) plus concise

    This helper does not invent scores, modify the BOUND decision, call an LLM,
    know about any agent framework, or execute a rollback or retry — it only
    *translates* the decision into an instruction the owning agent acts on.

    When a ``run`` context is supplied it is forwarded to
    :meth:`BoundWorkflow.evaluate_step`, which auto-records the step's lineage
    (``step_started`` + ``evaluation_recorded`` + ``outcome_recorded``) when
    lineage is enabled. The return type and value are unchanged when no ``run``
    is supplied (backwards compatible).

        criteria: The :class:`BoundCriteria` (threshold, weights, retry margin,
            rollback risk boundary) the policy evaluates against.
        workflow: Optional pre-built :class:`BoundWorkflow` (e.g. one sharing a
            specific :class:`~bound.contract_evaluator.ContractEvaluator`).
            Defaults to a fresh placeholder-free ``BoundWorkflow()``.

            enabled) the step's lineage is recorded automatically by the
            workflow. Defaults to the workflow evaluator's configured
            ``lineage_run`` when omitted.
        attempt: One-based attempt number recorded in lineage (default 1).
        step_id: Optional explicit step id for lineage; otherwise derived.
