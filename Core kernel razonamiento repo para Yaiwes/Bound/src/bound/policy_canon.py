"""Canonicalisation and hashing of the approved policy (BOUND v0.7.0, todo 4.2).

A decision must be reproducible from its recorded *policy hash*: two runs that
agree on the policy hash must have been governed by byte-for-byte equivalent
policy content. YAML formatting (key order, comments, indentation) must never
affect that hash, so the policy is reduced to a deterministic *canonical form*
before SHA-256 hashing.

This module owns:

* :func:`canonicalize_policy` — a deterministic, recursively key-sorted dict
  independent of the source YAML's formatting. Resolved effective weights and
  thresholds are part of the canonical form (todo 2.2/4.2).
* :func:`compute_policy_hash` — ``"sha256:<hex>"`` of the canonical policy.
* :func:`compute_contract_hash` — the canonical SHA-256 hex of a contract (bare
  64-char hex, consistent with :func:`bound.lineage.compute_contract_hash` so a
  policy-canonical contract hash matches the contract hash recorded in a
  :class:`~bound.lineage.RunConfigSnapshot`).
* :func:`policy_changed_since` — detect that the active policy changed between
  two snapshots during a run.
