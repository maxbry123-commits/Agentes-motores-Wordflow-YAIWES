"""Versioned BOUND watch event contract (v0.8.0).

The **watch protocol** defines the JSONL events an agent (or adapter) streams
to ``bound watch`` over stdin.  It is deliberately distinct from the
:mod:`~bound.lineage` module, which models BOUND's *internal* lineage events
that live in ``events.jsonl`` inside ``.bound/runs/<run_id>/``.

Design rules
------------
* Every event carries a ``schema_version`` field so ``bound watch`` can
  validate or reject unrecognised versions before dispatching.
* Every event carries a ``task_id`` so the watcher can group events into a
  single BOUND run even when the watcher restarts.
* All timestamps are UTC ISO-8601 strings with ``Z`` suffix
  (e.g. ``2026-07-20T14:30:00Z``).
* The ``event`` field is the discriminator tag — ``task_started``,
  ``step_completed``, ``verification_requested``, ``verification_completed``,
  ``decision_emitted``, ``control_action_reported``,
  ``control_action_observed``, ``task_finished``.
* Unknown event tags produce a typed validation error — the watcher never
  silently ignores unrecognised events.
* All fields use strict Pydantic validation: ``extra='forbid'``, no
  coercion, no mutable defaults.
