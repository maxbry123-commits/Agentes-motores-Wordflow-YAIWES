# BOUND — Deterministic Agent Execution Runtime

BOUND is a deterministic control harness for coding agents. Use the coding
agent already installed on your machine. BOUND adds evidence-based acceptance,
retries, replanning, checkpoints, rollback, candidate isolation, and replay.

**The agent proposes changes. BOUND controls what happens next.**

No LLM as judge, no telemetry, no network required.

## The four decisions

| Decision | Meaning | Agent action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ACCEPT** | Evidence satisfies the approved policy. | Stop optimizing, continue. |
| **RETRY** | The current approach is still viable. | Make one focused correction and collect fresh evidence. |
| **REPLAN** | The current strategy is no longer the right path. | Choose a materially different approach and derive a new step contract. |
| **ROLLBACK** | A hard risk boundary was exceeded. | Restore a previously confirmed safe checkpoint, then replan. |

## Quickstart

Pick your agent:

### Cline (VS Code)
```bash
pip install bound-policy
cd your-project
bound use cline       # detects .cline/, writes .cline/mcp/bound.json
                       # Cline sees BOUND tools: evaluate, checkpoint, decide, etc.
bound ui              # → http://127.0.0.1:8765
```

### Claude Code
```bash
pip install bound-policy
bound use claude-code  # detects claude on PATH
bound run --agent claude-code "Fix the failing validation tests"
# BOUND spawns Claude Code, reads stream-json output, runs pytest as evidence,
# and decides ACCEPT/RETRY/REPLAN based on results.
```

### Codex
```bash
pip install bound-policy
bound use codex        # detects codex on PATH
bound run --agent codex "Implement input validation"
```

### Any other agent
```bash
bound use generic --command "my-agent --jsonl"
bound run --agent generic --agent-command "my-agent --jsonl" "task"
```

### Watch it live
```bash
bound ui              # → http://127.0.0.1:8765  (Runs + Plans tabs)
bound status          # shows project, agent, control mode, last run
```

## How it works

### Integrated mode (Cline)
```
Cline reads .cline/mcp/bound.json → connects to BOUND MCP server via stdio.
During execution, Cline calls MCP tools at boundaries:

  bound_session_start → bound_step_start → bound_evidence_collect
  → bound_decide → {decision: "ACCEPT|RETRY|REPLAN|ROLLBACK"}
  → bound_checkpoint_create → bound_session_finish
```

### Supervised mode (Claude Code, Codex, generic)
```
bound run --agent claude-code "task"
  → BOUND detects agent → spawns agent process
  → reads structured JSON output → detects step boundaries
  → runs pytest/lint as independent evidence
  → ACCEPT (pass) | RETRY (fix) | REPLAN (new approach) | ROLLBACK (restore checkpoint)
  → repeats until accepted or budgets exhausted
```

## How weights and evidence work

BOUND never trusts agent self-reports. Every score is backed by a
**collector** — an independent process that actually runs commands, checks
exit codes, counts tests, and measures resource usage.

### The scoring formula

```
S = (W_A × A) + (W_I × I) - (W_R × R) - (W_C × C)
```

| Symbol | Meaning | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **A** | Acceptance | PytestCollector, JUnitCollector — were tests green? |
| **I** | Influence | Did the change improve coverage/material quality? |
| **R** | Risk | GitCollector — unexpected files? secrets in diff? |
| **C** | Cost | BudgetCollector — tool calls, tokens, runtime consumed? |

Weights (`W_A`, `W_I`, `W_R`, `W_C`) come from your `bound-policy.yaml`.

### Real evidence example

```python
from bound.command_collector import PytestCollector, CommandCollector, CommandSpec
from bound.contracts import AcceptanceCheck, StepContract
from bound.evidence import CheckEvidence, ExecutionEvidence
from bound.bound_workflow import BoundWorkflow
from bound.models import BoundCriteria

# 1. Run real verification (not agent self-report!)
runner = CommandCollector({
    "pytest": CommandSpec(argv=["uv", "run", "pytest", "-q"], timeout=60),
    "ruff":   CommandSpec(argv=["uv", "run", "ruff", "check", "."], timeout=30),
})
pytest_collector = PytestCollector(runner, command_name="pytest")

# 2. Collect evidence — BOUND executes the commands
test_evidence = pytest_collector.collect()
# test_evidence.passed = True/False
# test_evidence.provenance = VERIFIED (not CLAIMED!)

lint_result = runner.collect("ruff")
# lint_result.exit_code = 0 → clean

# 3. Build a contract
contract = StepContract(
    id="PHASE-003",
    description="Feature calculation",
    goal="Compute 14 features per card from real DB data",
    acceptance_checks=[
        AcceptanceCheck(
            id="tests-pass",
            description="40 tests pass",
            required=True,
            accepted_provenance=["verified", "observed"],
        ),
    ],
)

# 4. Evidence from real measurements
evidence = ExecutionEvidence(acceptance=[
    CheckEvidence(
        check_id="tests-pass",
        passed=test_evidence.passed,
        source="uv run pytest -q",
        provenance=test_evidence.provenance,
    ),
])

# 5. BOUND scores from evidence, not hardcoded
wf = BoundWorkflow()
result = wf.evaluate_step(
    contract=contract,
    evidence=evidence,
    criteria=BoundCriteria(threshold=0.70),
)
# result.decision → ACCEPT (when tests pass) or RETRY (when they don't)
```

### What the agent must NOT do

- ❌ Pass `--acceptance 1.0 --influence 0.0 --risk 0.0 --cost 0.0` — that's a rubber stamp
- ❌ Claim `provenance=VERIFIED` — the agent can only `CLAIM`
- ❌ Invent test counts, token usage, or runtime — `None` means unmeasured
