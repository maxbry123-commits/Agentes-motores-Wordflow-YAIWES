"""BOUND's own reference integration entry point (v0.6 Phase 10).

Runs BOUND's real verification commands, builds a real
:class:`~bound.evidence.ExecutionEvidence` from the captured output using the
pure :mod:`bound.collectors` parsers, evaluates it via BOUND's deterministic
policy, and writes ``bound_integration/run.json`` (a real
:class:`~bound.report.RunTrace`) plus ``bound_integration/INTEGRATION_REPORT.md``
(rendered from the same trace via :func:`bound.report.render_from_trace`).

Every value in the trace comes from a real run:

* the contract is the real ``PHASE-001`` :class:`~bound.contracts.StepContract`
  (the plan id is carried verbatim);
* the evidence is gathered by running the real ``uv run pytest`` commands and
  ``git status --porcelain`` — the raw stdout/stderr/exit code are captured
  from the *same* run as the structured evidence;
* the evaluation is BOUND's deterministic output (scores, score, threshold,
  decision, ``next_action``) — never manually reconstructed;
* ``token_usage`` / ``runtime_seconds`` / agent tool-call telemetry stay ``None``
  — this environment cannot observe them, so they are never fabricated.

Recursion safety
----------------
When this module spawns ``uv run pytest`` it sets the
:data:`NESTED_GUARD_ENVVAR` environment variable in the subprocess so a nested
pytest run can detect re-entry and skip any test that would itself invoke this
integration (mirroring the benchmark's ``BOUND_INTEGRATION_NESTED`` guard). No
current BOUND test triggers that path, but the guard is documented and
defensive.

Invoke directly::

    uv run python -m examples.reference_integration.run_demo
    # or
    uv run python examples/reference_integration/run_demo.py
