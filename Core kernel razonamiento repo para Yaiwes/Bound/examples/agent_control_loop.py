"""BOUND v0.6 — runnable multi-step agent control-loop example (Phase 7).

Demonstrates a realistic agent trajectory driven by BOUND's *real* public API:

    StepContract + ExecutionEvidence + ContractEvaluator + BoundPolicy
        -> EvaluationResult (REPLAN / RETRY / ACCEPT)
        -> AgentControlResult (replan / retry / continue)

The agent works on a small coding task: "Add input validation to the
registration endpoint, with tests for valid, invalid, and edge-case input."
Three attempts are simulated, each providing richer :class:`ExecutionEvidence`
(standing in for what a real agent execution + evidence collector would record):

    Attempt 1: only the valid-input check passes  -> A=1/3 -> REPLAN
    Attempt 2: valid + invalid checks pass        -> A=2/3 -> RETRY
    Attempt 3: all three required checks pass     -> A=3/3 -> ACCEPT

Nothing is hardcoded: scores come from the deterministic
:class:`ContractEvaluator`, the decision from the deterministic
:class:`BoundPolicy`, and the control action from the deterministic
:func:`bound.integration.evaluate_agent_step` mapping. No LLM, no network.

Stable plan IDs (v0.6 Phase 6)
------------------------------
This step carries the stable identifier ``PHASE-001`` exactly as a repository
``PLAN.md`` would record it, and that same id is preserved unchanged across
``PLAN.md -> StepContract(id="PHASE-001") -> printed trajectory``. A replan of
this step would append ``-R<N>`` (``PHASE-001-R1``) rather than replace the id,
so the root identity (and its history) is never lost. The example deliberately
consumes the public :func:`bound.integration.evaluate_agent_step` API and does
**not** re-implement the BOUND decision->action mapping: that translation has
exactly one runtime source (``bound.integration._DECISION_TO_ACTION``).

The "avoided hypothetical extra steps" are explicitly labelled *simulated*
because they are not measured from a real agent run — they illustrate how
ACCEPT stops unnecessary further optimization.
