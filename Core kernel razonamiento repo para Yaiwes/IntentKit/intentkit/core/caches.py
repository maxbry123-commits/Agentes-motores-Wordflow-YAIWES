"""In-process executor caches.

Every compiled-graph cache in ``core`` lives here, in one module that imports
nothing from ``core`` itself. That placement is deliberate: the modules that
*build* executors (``core.executor``, ``core.lead.sub_agents``) sit above the
modules that only *look up* a cached one (``core.chat``), so keeping the
dictionaries with either builder forced a lookup-side import back up the stack
and closed an import cycle. Owning the storage down here lets both sides depend
on this module instead of on each other.

Only storage and pure dictionary bookkeeping belong here — anything that has to
build an executor stays with its builder.
