"""Read a tracked ``anchor@1`` file that CARRIES a previously attested chain head.

Nothing here is trusted. The anchor is a *carried claim* whose only function is to
give an attestation lookup a digest to ask about: GitHub exposes no endpoint that
lists attestations without a subject digest, so an attestation can corroborate a
head but can never discover one. Anchor trust is therefore exactly ordinary write
access to the anchor file — no better, and the same class of limit as ADR 0002's
"the worker can edit the verifier".

Pure: no environment, no network, no signing, no subprocess.
