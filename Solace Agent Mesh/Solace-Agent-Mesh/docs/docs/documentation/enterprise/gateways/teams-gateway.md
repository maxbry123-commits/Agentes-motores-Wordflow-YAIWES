# Microsoft Teams Gateway Setup — Web Interface (SAM Cloud & SAM Kubernetes)

:::info[Which guide is this?]
This guide is for users deploying the Teams Gateway through the **Agent Mesh Enterprise web interface** (SAM Cloud or SAM Kubernetes). For Docker or wheel-based deployments without the web interface, see the [Manual Configuration guide](../../developing/tutorials/teams-integration.md).
:::

This guide explains how to configure the Microsoft Teams Gateway in Agent Mesh Enterprise. The guide covers both **Solace Agent Mesh (SAM) Cloud** and **SAM Kubernetes** environments.

## Overview

The Teams Gateway connects your agents to Microsoft Teams, allowing users to interact with AI agents directly from Teams chats and channels. The gateway receives messages from Teams via an HTTPS endpoint (`/api/messages`) and routes them to your agents.

Teams requires the gateway's endpoint to be **publicly accessible via HTTPS**. The setup differs depending on your deployment environment.

### Supported Features

- **Personal chats**: Direct 1:1 messaging with the bot
- **Group chats**: The bot responds when @mentioned in group conversations
- **Team channels**: The bot responds when @mentioned in team channels
- **File uploads**: Send files to the bot in personal chats (CSV, JSON, PDF, YAML, XML, images, and more)
- **File downloads**: Receive files from agents via the Teams FileConsentCard approval flow
- **Streaming responses**: Real-time message updates as agents process requests
- **Typing indicator**: Shows a typing indicator while processing
- **Session management**: Sessions reset automatically at midnight UTC daily


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1. An **Azure account** with:
   - Permission to create **App Registrations** in Microsoft Entra ID (most organizations allow this by default; if disabled, ask your admin for the **Application Developer** role)
   - **Contributor** role (or higher) on an Azure subscription or resource group to create the Bot Service resource
2. Access to the **Agent Mesh Enterprise web interface** with permissions to create and deploy gateways
3. Permission to upload custom apps in **Microsoft Teams**:
   - For personal or team use: Your Teams admin must enable the **"Upload custom apps"** policy for your account
   - For organization-wide deployment: A **Teams Administrator** must upload and approve the app via the [Teams Admin Center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com)

## Step 1: Create an Azure App Registration

The App Registration provides authentication credentials for the gateway. Follow Microsoft's official guide to [register an application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app), then create a client secret under **Certificates & secrets**.

Use the following settings so the registration is compatible with the Teams Gateway:

| Microsoft field | Required value |
|---|---|
| **Supported account types** | Accounts in this organizational directory only (single tenant) |
| **Redirect URI** | Leave blank |
| **Certificates & secrets** | Create a new **client secret** and copy the **Value** immediately (it is shown only once) |

After creation, collect these values — you will plug them into the Agent Mesh gateway in [Step 4](#step-4-create-and-deploy-the-gateway-in-agent-mesh):

| Microsoft value (from App registration) | Agent Mesh gateway field |
|---|---|
| **Application (client) ID** | Microsoft App ID |
| **Directory (tenant) ID** | Microsoft App Tenant ID |
| **Client secret — Value** | Microsoft App Password |

The exact Azure Portal UI may change over time. The steps below reflect the flow at the time of writing and are provided as a convenience. If the portal looks different, defer to Microsoft's linked guide above.

1. Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Navigate to **App registrations**
3. Click **New registration**
   - **Name**: Choose a name (e.g., `SAM Teams Bot`)
   - **Supported account types**: Select **Accounts in this organizational directory only** (single tenant)
   - **Redirect URI**: Leave blank
4. Click **Register**
5. On the overview page, copy the **Application (client) ID** — this is your **Microsoft App ID** for Agent Mesh
6. Copy the **Directory (tenant) ID** — this is your **Microsoft App Tenant ID** for Agent Mesh
7. Go to **Certificates & secrets** > **Client secrets** > **New client secret**
   - **Description**: e.g., `SAM Bot Secret`
   - **Expires**: Choose an appropriate duration
8. Copy the secret **Value** immediately (it will not be shown again) — this is your **Microsoft App Password** for Agent Mesh

</details>

## Step 2: Create an Azure Bot Service

The Bot Service registers your bot with Microsoft Teams. Follow Microsoft's guide to [create an Azure Bot resource and enable the Teams channel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/configure-bot-capability).

Use the following settings so the bot works with the Teams Gateway:

| Microsoft field | Required value |
|---|---|
| **Type of App** | Single Tenant |
| **Creation type** | Use existing app registration |
| **App ID** | Application (client) ID from Step 1 |
| **Tenant ID** | Directory (tenant) ID from Step 1 |
| **Channels** | Enable the **Microsoft Teams** channel (Messaging enabled, Calling disabled) |
| **Messaging endpoint** | Leave blank for now — you will set this in [Step 6](#step-6-configure-the-gateway-endpoint-in-azure-bot-service) after the gateway endpoint is available |

<details>
<summary>Example walkthrough (Azure Portal UI as of this writing — for reference only)</summary>

The exact Azure Portal UI may change over time. The steps below reflect the flow at the time of writing and are provided as a convenience. If the portal looks different, defer to Microsoft's linked guide above.

1. In the Azure Portal, search for **Azure Bot** and click **Create**
2. Fill in the required fields:
   - **Bot handle**: A globally unique name (e.g., `sam-teams-bot`)
   - **Subscription**: Your Azure subscription
   - **Resource group**: Create new or select existing
   - **Pricing tier**: **F0 (Free)** for testing, or **S1 (Standard)** for production
   - **Type of App**: Select **Single Tenant**
   - **Creation type**: **Use existing app registration**
   - **App ID**: Paste the Application (client) ID from Step 1
   - **Tenant ID**: Paste the Directory (tenant) ID from Step 1
3. Click **Review + create** > **Create**
4. After the resource is created, go to the bot resource
5. Navigate to **Configuration**
   - **Messaging endpoint**: Leave blank for now. You will set the gateway endpoint in Step 6.
6. Navigate to **Channels** > click the **Microsoft Teams** icon
7. Ensure **Messaging** is enabled, leave **Calling** disabled
8. Accept the terms of service and click **Apply**

</details>

## Step 3: Create and Install the Teams App

Create a Teams app package (a ZIP containing `manifest.json` plus a color and outline icon) and upload it to Teams. Follow Microsoft's guide to [upload a custom Teams app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/deploy-and-publish/apps-upload).

The manifest must declare the bot with the scopes and capabilities the gateway expects. The example below is a minimal manifest that works with the Teams Gateway — replace `<YOUR_APP_ID>` with the **Application (client) ID** from Step 1 and update the developer information with your organization's details.

> **Note**: This is an example and the manifest schema may change over time. See the [Teams app manifest schema reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema) for the latest version.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/teams/v1.22/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "manifestVersion": "1.22",
  "id": "<YOUR_APP_ID>",
  "name": {
    "short": "Agent Mesh Bot",
    "full": "Solace Agent Mesh Teams Gateway"
  },
  "developer": {
    "name": "Your Organization",
    "websiteUrl": "https://yourorg.com/",
    "privacyUrl": "https://yourorg.com/privacy",
    "termsOfUseUrl": "https://yourorg.com/terms"
  },
  "description": {
    "short": "AI-powered intelligent assistant for Teams",
    "full": "Connect to the Solace Agent Mesh Teams Gateway to access AI agents for task automation, data analysis, document creation, and intelligent assistance directly through Microsoft Teams."
  },
  "icons": {
    "outline": "outline.png",
    "color": "color.png"
  },
  "accentColor": "#ffffff",
  "bots": [
    {
      "botId": "<YOUR_APP_ID>",
      "scopes": [
        "personal",
        "team",
        "groupChat"
      ],
      "isNotificationOnly": false,
      "supportsCalling": false,
      "supportsVideo": false,
      "supportsFiles": true
    }
  ],
  "permissions": [
    "identity",
    "messageTeamMembers"
  ],
  "validDomains": []
}
```

The gateway relies on these manifest values specifically:

| Manifest field | Required value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `bots[0].botId` | Application (client) ID from Step 1 | Links the Teams app to your Azure Bot |
| `bots[0].scopes` | `personal`, `team`, `groupChat` | Enables 1:1 chats, team channels, and group chats |
| `bots[0].supportsFiles` | `true` | Required if you want users to send/receive files |
| `permissions` | `identity`, `messageTeamMembers` | Required for the gateway to identify users and post messages |

Icons: Teams requires a `color.png` (192×192) and `outline.png` (32×32, white on transparent).

> **Note**: Uploading a custom app may require Teams Administrator approval depending on your organization's app policies.

<details>
<summary>Example walkthrough: package and upload (Teams UI as of this writing — for reference only)</summary>

The exact Teams and Developer Portal UIs may change over time. The steps below reflect the flow at the time of writing and are provided as a convenience. If the interface looks different, defer to Microsoft's linked guide above.

1. Create a ZIP file containing: `manifest.json`, `color.png`, `outline.png`
2. Upload using one of the following methods:

**Option A: Import via Teams Developer Portal**
1. Go to the [Teams Developer Portal](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com)
2. Select **Apps** > **Import app** and upload the ZIP file
3. Review and edit the app configuration if needed
4. Go to **Publish** > **Publish to org** to submit for admin approval

**Option B: Upload via Teams (for personal or team use)**
1. In Microsoft Teams, go to **Apps** > **Manage your apps** > **Upload an app**
2. Select **Upload a custom app** and choose the ZIP file

**Option C: Upload via Teams Admin Center (for organization-wide deployment)**
1. Ask your Teams Administrator to upload the app via the [Teams Admin Center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com) under **Teams apps** > **Manage apps** > **Upload new app**
2. Once uploaded, the app is available to users in the organization

</details>

## Step 4: Create and Deploy the Gateway in Agent Mesh

In the Agent Mesh Enterprise web interface, create a new Teams Gateway and provide the Azure credentials:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Microsoft App ID** | Application (client) ID from Step 1 |
| **Microsoft App Password** | Client secret Value from Step 1 |
| **Microsoft App Tenant ID** | Directory (tenant) ID from Step 1 |
| **Default Agent** | The agent to handle messages (defaults to OrchestratorAgent) |

After saving, **deploy the gateway** from the Agent Mesh Enterprise web interface. SAM creates the gateway pod and networking resources only after you deploy the gateway.

## Step 5: Obtain the Gateway Endpoint

This step differs based on your SAM environment.

---

### Option A: SAM Cloud

In SAM Cloud, the platform automatically provisions a public endpoint for your Teams gateway when you deploy it.

1. After deploying the gateway in the Agent Mesh Enterprise web interface, the platform provides you with the **gateway endpoint** in the gateway details.
2. Your gateway endpoint is:

   ```
   https://<provided-gateway-hostname>/api/messages
   ```

3. Copy this URL -- you will configure the URL in Azure Bot Service in Step 6

> **Note**: The gateway endpoint is publicly accessible via HTTPS. No additional networking setup is required.

---

### Option B: SAM Kubernetes

In SAM Kubernetes, the platform creates a **ClusterIP Service** for the gateway. This service is accessible only within the Kubernetes cluster. You must expose the gateway endpoint("/api/messages") to the public internet so that Microsoft Teams can reach the gateway.

#### What SAM Creates

When you deploy the Teams gateway, SAM creates a ClusterIP Kubernetes Service. For example: (Shown here for reference only so you can identify it in your cluster.)

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: gw-<dns-id>
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
    - port: 8092
      targetPort: 8092
      protocol: TCP
      name: gateway
```

The `<dns-id>` is a unique identifier generated by SAM for each gateway. The platform configures the service name and port automatically during deployment.

#### Expose the Endpoint Publicly

You need to make `https://<your-gateway-hostname>/api/messages` publicly accessible. Common approaches:

**Option 1: Ingress Controller**

Create an Ingress resource that routes traffic to the gateway service. The following is an example using an AWS ALB Ingress, you need to update the template with your network's configuration.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: teams-gateway-ingress
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: alb
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme: internet-facing
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type: ip
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/listen-ports: '[{"HTTPS":443}]'
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/certificate-arn: <your-acm-certificate-arn>
    # Recommended: ensure the ALB health check targets the gateway's health endpoint
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/healthcheck-path: /health
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/success-codes: "200"
    # If using external-dns, add this annotation to create DNS records automatically:
    # external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname: gw-example.yourdomain.com
spec:
  ingressClassName: alb
  rules:
    - host: <your-gateway-hostname>
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: gw-<dns-id>
                port:
                  number: 8092
```

> **Note**: The `gw-<dns-id>` in the Ingress backend is the Kubernetes Service name created by SAM during deployment. To find this value, run `kubectl get services -n <namespace>` and look for the service prefixed with `gw-`. This example uses AWS ALB annotations -- for other ingress controllers (NGINX, Traefik, GKE), adapt the annotations accordingly. The key requirements are:
> - TLS termination (HTTPS) at the ingress
> - Route to the gateway service on port 8092

To expose **multiple Teams gateways**, add a rule per gateway with a unique hostname. You can use a single Ingress resource for all gateways rather than creating separate Ingress resources:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: teams-gateway-ingress
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: alb
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme: internet-facing
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type: ip
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/listen-ports: '[{"HTTPS":443}]'
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/certificate-arn: <your-acm-certificate-arn>
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/healthcheck-path: /health
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/success-codes: "200"
    # List all gateway hostnames (comma-separated) for external-dns:
    # external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname: gw-first.yourdomain.com,gw-second.yourdomain.com
spec:
  ingressClassName: alb
  rules:
    - host: gw-first.yourdomain.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: gw-<first-dns-id>
                port:
                  number: 8092
    - host: gw-second.yourdomain.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: gw-<second-dns-id>
                port:
                  number: 8092
```

When adding a new gateway, add a new rule with its hostname and service name, and update the `external-dns` hostname annotation to include the new hostname.

If your cluster does not have [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) configured, you will also need to create a DNS record manually. For example:

1. Get the load balancer hostname (may take 1-2 minutes to provision):
   ```bash
   kubectl get ingress teams-gateway-ingress -n <namespace> -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}'
   ```
2. In your DNS provider (Route 53, Cloudflare, etc.), create a **CNAME** record:
   ```
   sam-teams.yourdomain.com -> <load balancer hostname from above>
   ```
   If using Route 53 with an ALB, you can use an **Alias** record instead.

**Option 2: LoadBalancer Service**

Create a new LoadBalancer Service that forwards traffic to the gateway pod. Configure TLS termination on the cloud load balancer.

**Option 3: Reverse Proxy**

Place the gateway behind an existing reverse proxy (e.g., NGINX, Envoy) that handles TLS and forwards traffic to the ClusterIP service.

#### Your Gateway Endpoint

Once exposed, your gateway endpoint will be:

```
https://<your-gateway-hostname>/api/messages
```

> **Important**: The endpoint **must** be accessible via HTTPS. Microsoft Teams will not send messages to HTTP endpoints.

To verify your setup, open `https://<your-gateway-hostname>/health` in a browser. You should see a JSON health response from the gateway, confirming the gateway is publicly accessible.

---

## Step 6: Configure the Gateway Endpoint in Azure Bot Service

On the Azure Bot resource you created in Step 2, update the **Messaging endpoint** to point at your gateway. See Microsoft's guide to [set the bot messaging endpoint](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/configure-bot-capability).

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Messaging endpoint** | SAM Cloud: `https://<provided-gateway-hostname>/api/messages`<br/>SAM Kubernetes: `https://<your-gateway-hostname>/api/messages` |

<details>
<summary>Example walkthrough (Azure Portal UI as of this writing — for reference only)</summary>

The exact Azure Portal UI may change over time. The steps below reflect the flow at the time of writing and are provided as a convenience. If the portal looks different, defer to Microsoft's linked guide above.

1. Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Navigate to your **Azure Bot** resource
3. Go to **Configuration**
4. Set the **Messaging endpoint** to your gateway endpoint:
   - SAM Cloud: `https://<provided-gateway-hostname>/api/messages`
   - SAM Kubernetes: `https://<your-gateway-hostname>/api/messages`
5. Click **Apply**

</details>

## Verification

After completing all steps, verify the setup:

1. Open Microsoft Teams
2. Find and open your bot app (search by the name you gave it)
3. Send a message (e.g., "Hello")
4. You should see a processing indicator followed by a response from your agent

## Troubleshooting

### Bot does not respond to messages

- Verify the **Messaging endpoint** in Azure Bot Service matches your gateway URL exactly (including `/api/messages`)
- Confirm the gateway pod is running: check the deployment status in the Agent Mesh Enterprise web interface
- For SAM Kubernetes: verify the endpoint is publicly accessible by opening `https://<your-gateway-hostname>/health` in a browser -- you should see a JSON health response
- Check that the **Microsoft App ID** and **Microsoft App Password** in Agent Mesh match your Azure App Registration credentials

### Authentication errors

- Ensure the **Microsoft App Password** (client secret) has not expired in Azure -- regenerate in **App registrations** > **Certificates & secrets** if needed
- Verify the **Tenant ID** is set correctly in both Agent Mesh and Azure

### Gateway endpoint requirements

- Must use **HTTPS** (not HTTP)
- Must be **publicly accessible** from the internet
