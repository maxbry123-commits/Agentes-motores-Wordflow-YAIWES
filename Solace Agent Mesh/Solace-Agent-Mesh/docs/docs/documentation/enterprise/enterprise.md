# Agent Mesh Enterprise

Agent Mesh Enterprise extends the open-source framework with features that enterprise environments require. It is available as a self-managed container image that you can deploy in your own infrastructure. You can obtain access by joining the pilot program at [solace.com/solace-agent-mesh-pilot-registration](https://solace.com/solace-agent-mesh-pilot-registration/).

## Enterprise Features

Agent Mesh Enterprise provides the following capabilities beyond the Community edition:

- **Authentication and authorization** — Integrates with your existing identity systems through SSO, eliminating the need for separate credentials and maintaining security standards. You can configure role-based access control to implement authorization policies that determine which agents and resources each user can access through the Agent Mesh Gateways. The Platform Service shares this same authentication and authorization stack with the WebUI Gateway, so a single configuration secures both services. For details, see [Authentication and Authorization](platform-service-auth.md).

- **Data management** — Helps you optimize costs and improve accuracy. Filtering capabilities reduce unnecessary compute expenses, and data governance helps prevent hallucinations by controlling what information reaches your language models.

- **Observability** — Provides visibility into your agent ecosystem. The built-in workflow viewer tracks LLM interactions and agent communications in real time, allowing you to monitor performance, diagnose issues, and understand system behavior.

- **Offline evaluations** — Lets you measure and track agent quality against a prepared set of prompts without touching the running system. You define datasets of example prompts, create reusable evaluators that score responses, combine them into experiments that target specific agents, and trigger runs on demand. Results are stored in the database and can be compared across model updates, prompt changes, or configuration adjustments over time.

## Getting Started with Enterprise

Setting up Agent Mesh Enterprise involves installation, security configuration, and authentication setup.

### Installation

Agent Mesh Enterprise is deployed on Kubernetes using Helm. The [Kubernetes Quick Start](quickstart-kubernetes.md) gets you running in approximately 10 minutes with zero required configuration, using an embedded broker suitable for evaluation. For production environments, see [Production Kubernetes Deployment](production-kubernetes.md), which covers external broker configuration, persistent storage, and resource tuning. For air-gapped or restricted environments, see [Air-Gapped Kubernetes Installation](airgap-kubernetes.md).

### Access Control

Role-based access control lets you define who can access which agents and features in your deployment. You create roles that represent job functions, assign permissions to those roles through scopes, and then assign roles to users. This three-tier model implements the principle of least privilege while simplifying administration. For guidance on planning and implementing RBAC, see [Setting Up RBAC](rbac-setup-guide.md).

### Single Sign-On

SSO integration connects Agent Mesh Enterprise with your organization's identity provider, whether you use Azure, Google, Auth0, Okta, Keycloak, or another OAuth2-compliant system. The configuration process involves creating YAML files that define the authentication service and provider settings, then launching the container with the appropriate environment variables. For step-by-step configuration instructions, see [Enabling SSO](single-sign-on.md).

### Connectors

Connectors link agents to external data sources such as databases and APIs, enabling agents to retrieve and analyze information through natural language interactions. The Enterprise version supports SQL connectors for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB databases. You create connectors in the Connectors section of the web interface, where they become available for assignment to any agent in your deployment. All agents assigned to a connector share the same credentials, requiring careful planning of data source permissions to maintain appropriate access control. For information about creating and managing connectors, see [Connectors](connectors/connectors.md).

### Agent Builder

The Enterprise version includes Agent Builder, a visual interface for creating and managing agents without writing configuration files directly. Agent Builder supports both AI-assisted generation from natural language descriptions and manual configuration for precise control over agent capabilities. You can create agents, assign toolsets and connectors, and deploy them dynamically through the Deployer component without restarting services. The Deployer handles deployment operations asynchronously, enabling scalable agent creation through the web interface. You can also download agent configurations as YAML files for version control or infrastructure-as-code deployments. For comprehensive information about creating and managing agents, see [Agent Builder](agent-builder.md).

### Gateways

Gateways connect external systems to your Agent Mesh deployment, enabling users and applications to interact with agents through platforms like Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Solace Event Mesh brokers. You can configure integration points through guided workflows without writing YAML configuration files manually. Gateways use the same Deployer infrastructure as Agent Builder, enabling you to deploy gateways dynamically and monitor their status through the web interface. Each gateway type has specific configuration options for authentication, message routing, and protocol settings. For comprehensive information about creating and managing gateways, see [Gateways](gateways/gateways.md).

### Offline Evaluations

Offline evaluations give you a browser-based workflow for testing deployed agents against curated prompt sets and tracking quality over time. You build a dataset of prompts, configure an evaluator that defines how responses are scored, and set up an experiment that binds them to a target agent and one or more language model configurations. Triggering a run sends each prompt to the live agent, captures the response, scores it, and stores the result for inspection and comparison. Score trends appear on the Reports dashboard, making regressions visible across model updates or prompt changes without any changes to the running system. For the full walkthrough, see [Offline Evaluations](offline-evaluations.md).

## What's Next

After you complete the initial setup and create agents using Agent Builder, you can begin deploying them to make them available for user interactions. You can also create gateways to connect Agent Mesh with external systems like Slack workspaces and Event Mesh brokers. The Enterprise features operate transparently—your agents and tools work the same way, but with the added security, governance, and observability that production environments require.
