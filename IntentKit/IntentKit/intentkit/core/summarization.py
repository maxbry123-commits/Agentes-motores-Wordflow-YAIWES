"""Conversation-history compression middleware.

Replaces LangChain's ``SummarizationMiddleware`` with an implementation
tailored to IntentKit's chat threads:

- **Time-tiered trigger.** The per-model ``compress_cold/warm/hot``
  thresholds (see ``LLMModelInfo.compress_thresholds``) are selected by how
  long ago the previous LLM request in this thread happened: within an hour
  the *hot* threshold applies (compress rarely, keep the prompt cache warm),
  within a day *warm*, and beyond that *cold* (the cache is gone anyway, so
  compress aggressively to cut input cost).
- **Round-aware compaction.** A "round" starts at each user message. The
  first round is kept but stripped down to the user message plus the agent's
  first text reply (tool calls and thinking dropped); the previous complete
  round and the in-progress current round are kept verbatim; everything in
  between is replaced by an LLM-written summary. When only one complete
  round exists it counts as the previous round and is kept whole. If the
  kept rounds alone would exceed the cold threshold, the whole history
  before the current round is summarized instead.
- **Chunked summarization.** When the text to summarize would not fit in
  the summarizer model's context, it is folded chunk by chunk: summarize the
  first chunk, prepend that summary to the next chunk, summarize again.
- **Fail-safe.** If the summarizer call fails, compaction is skipped and the
  full history is kept for this request — an error string must never
  replace real conversation history.
