# Release v2.39.0

## Model Updates

- **GLM 5.3 Flash** — Z.ai's new flash model replaces GLM 4.7 Flash. It is a major step up: a 1M-token context window (5x larger), it can now read images and video, and it reasons on every request. It launches at half price, so it currently costs only slightly more than the model it replaces. Agents on GLM 4.7 Flash move over automatically.
- **Qwen3.8 Flash** — Alibaba's newest flash model replaces Qwen3.7 Flash, with better quality across the board and double the maximum output length. Agents on the previous version move over automatically.
- **Ox Alpha has been retired.** The free preview period for this anonymous stealth model has ended and its provider has withdrawn it. By all the evidence it was GLM 5.3 Flash in disguise, so the same model remains available above under its real name. The few agents created with Ox Alpha as their model during the one-week trial need to be pointed at another model; new agents default to Gemini 3.7 Flash again.

## Improvements

- Strengthened the safeguards on the model catalog so that models routed through OpenRouter are always served by their vetted upstream provider.

# Release v2.38.0

## Video Generation

The video toolset is now three models instead of six, and every one of them runs through OpenRouter:

- **Seedance 2.0 Mini** — the fast, inexpensive option, for drafts and quick iteration.
- **Seedance 2.5** — best for long-form storytelling and generating from a reference image.
- **MiniMax H3** — omni-modal generation with native audio, up to 2K.

**Sora, Sora Pro, Veo, Veo Fast and Grok video have been retired.** Agents that had any of these enabled will simply no longer show them; nothing else in the agent's setup changes, and MiniMax Hailuo keeps working under its existing entry, now on the newer H3 model. OpenAI is shutting its video API down entirely in September with no replacement, so Sora would have stopped working regardless.

**Video is now billed on what it actually costs.** Previously each video tool charged a fixed price per call, which meant short clips subsidised long ones. Charges now follow the real cost of the generation — model, resolution and length — so a quick draft costs a fraction of a long high-resolution render.

All three models are also available for image-to-video: supply a starting image and the model animates from it.

## Improvements

- Refreshed the platform's upstream dependencies, picking up upstream fixes across the model and payment integrations.
- Improved how failures from model providers are recognised, so temporary provider problems are retried and permanent ones surface promptly instead of being retried in vain.
- Fixed an issue where a starting image supplied in a format other than PNG could be misread by the provider.
- Fixed bugs in the video generation and agent payment modules.

# Release v2.37.0

## Model Updates

- **DeepSeek V4 Flash now understands images.** DeepSeek's multimodal build of V4 Flash replaces the text-only one, at the same speed and text quality, so the platform's cheapest workhorse model can now read charts, screenshots and documents. Agents on the previous version move over automatically — no action needed. It is an experimental build from DeepSeek, so image handling may change without notice.

## Improvements

- Corrected the billing rates recorded for the DeepSeek models, which sat below what DeepSeek actually charges.

# Release v2.36.0

## Model Updates

- **Gemini 3.7 Flash** — Google's newest Flash replaces Gemini 3.6 Flash, both on Google directly and through OpenRouter. It is faster on agent workflows and multi-step reasoning, and Google has halved Flash pricing through the end of 2026, so it now costs half of what 3.6 did.
- **Cheaper Gemini through OpenRouter** — Gemini requests routed through OpenRouter now go to Google's Vertex endpoint, which is currently discounted a further 50% below the AI Studio endpoint. Gemini 3.7 Flash on OpenRouter is a quarter of 3.6's launch price.
- **GLM 5.3** — Z.ai's upgrade replaces GLM 5.2 at the same price, with a large step up on coding and long-running agent tasks.

Agents still set to Gemini 3.6 Flash or GLM 5.2 are moved to the new models automatically — no action needed. The built-in web search's Gemini fallback also moves to 3.7 Flash.

# Release v2.35.0

## Model Updates

- **Ox Alpha (Free)** — a new preview model from OpenRouter is now available to every team, free of charge while the preview lasts. It is a reasoning model built for coding and long-running agent work, understands images and video as well as text, and handles a million tokens of context. Note that as a preview offering it runs slower than the production models in the catalog, and the provider retains prompts and completions (they are not used for training).
- **Ox Alpha is the default model for new agents** during this trial period. Existing agents keep whatever model they were configured with; the model picker still lists every other option.

# Release v2.34.1

## Improvements

- Routine dependency maintenance across the whole platform: the AI provider SDKs, web framework, database drivers, management frontend, and messaging integrations were all brought up to their latest releases.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed bugs in the agent engine's error handling that surfaced with the latest OpenAI SDK update: brief network interruptions are reliably retried again, and requests that run out of time are now reported as timeouts instead of a generic internal error.

# Release v2.34.0

## Model Updates

- **Grok 4.6** — xAI's newest flagship replaces Grok 4.5, with stronger coding and knowledge performance and a new extra-deep reasoning level for the hardest problems. Available both via xAI directly and through OpenRouter.
- **Qwen3.8 Max** — Alibaba's new flagship replaces Qwen3.7 Max and can now understand images and video, not just text.
- **DeepSeek V4 Pro** — upgraded to the official general-availability build on OpenRouter.

Agents still set to the previous model versions are moved to the new ones automatically — no action needed.

# Release v2.33.0

## Security

- **Closed a server-side request forgery hole reported privately by an outside security researcher.** The website scraping tools fetched any address an agent conversation named, without checking where it pointed. That let the platform be steered at its own internal network or at a cloud provider's metadata service, and because the scraper indexes what it retrieves, the response could then be read back out of the agent's knowledge base.

- **Every tool that fetches an address is now protected by one shared check, not several.** The platform previously carried three separate versions of this protection, each covering slightly different ground, and several fetching paths had none at all. All of them now share a single check that classifies the destination before the request, again after the address is resolved, and once more for every hop when a site forwards the request elsewhere. Anything aimed at an internal, reserved, or metadata address is refused before a connection is opened.

- **The shared check also covers routes the previous versions missed**, including addresses that resolve to an internal destination only at request time, IPv6 wrappers around internal addresses, and the metadata endpoints of additional cloud providers. Fetching tools that had no protection at all — image editing and upscaling, image inputs to the image generators, paid HTTP requests, link previews, and stored-image downloads — are now covered on the same terms.

## Improvements

- Web page reading is cheaper and more reliable: plain-text and data endpoints are fetched directly instead of going through the browser-rendering service, rendering calls are paced to stay inside the service's rate limit, and rate-limit responses are retried automatically.
- Publishing a post no longer fails when extra or blank tags are supplied; the extras are dropped instead of wasting the agent's turn.
- Internal helper tasks such as page cleanup, memory merging, and search result formatting no longer spend reasoning effort on mechanical work, cutting a substantial amount of weekly token usage with no change in output quality.

# Release v2.32.3

## Improvements

- Routine dependency maintenance across the platform: the backend libraries and the management console's web framework, UI libraries, and development tooling were updated to their latest patch releases for security and stability. No user-facing changes.

# Release v2.32.2

## Bug Fixes

- Agent activity and post feeds now load correctly when the page address uses the agent's custom URL name. Previously, reloading an agent's activities or posts page could show an empty list even though the agent had content, and opening a single post from such an address could fail with a "not found" error.
- Requesting content for an agent that doesn't exist now returns a clear "not found" error instead of a silently empty list.

## Improvements

- Every agent management endpoint in the local API now accepts the agent's custom URL name interchangeably with its ID, so all pages behave consistently after the address bar switches to the friendly URL.
- Consolidated the internal agent lookup logic into a single shared helper, reducing the chance of this class of bug recurring in future endpoints.

# Release v2.32.1

## Security

- Updated a low-level text-pattern dependency in the web app to close a recently disclosed denial-of-service weakness that could crash the build tooling on malicious input. No user-facing changes.

# Release v2.32.0

## Model Catalog Refresh

- **GPT-5.6 price cuts passed through.** OpenAI reduced Terra by 20% and Luna by 80%; on OpenRouter both tiers currently run at half of OpenAI's list price, and the catalog now reflects each channel's real rate. Cached input stays at 10% of the input price everywhere.
- **DeepSeek V4 Flash official build.** Agents on DeepSeek V4 Flash now get the official release build, which posts large gains on agent and coding benchmarks. Existing agents move over automatically — no changes needed. Its maximum response length also grew twelvefold.
- **Qwen Flash upgraded to 3.7.** The new generation understands images and video, costs roughly a tenth of the previous flash on input, and existing agents are migrated automatically.
- **Across-the-board price corrections.** Every OpenRouter model's price is now sourced from the first-party endpoint we actually route to, rather than marketplace-wide averages. Several models became cheaper (Qwen Max, MiniMax M3, both MiMo tiers, Grok cache reads), one had been undercharged and was corrected (GLM 5.2), and DeepSeek cache-hit pricing is now consistent across channels.
- Fixed a routing configuration that could prevent Kimi K3 requests from reaching Moonshot's servers.

## Team Lead

- The built-in team lead orchestrator now runs on DeepSeek's new V4 Flash build, which leads agent-orchestration benchmarks while costing a fraction of the previous default model.

## Platform

- Connections to remote MCP tool servers were upgraded to the latest protocol SDK, and the service now properly identifies itself to those servers.
- On startup, the service now waits for its database, cache, and storage to be reachable before accepting work, making deploys and restarts more predictable.
- Routine AI SDK upgrades across the model integrations.

# Release v2.31.2

## Bug Fixes

- Editing an agent that has a custom URL name now saves correctly. Previously, if you opened an agent's edit page, made a change, and reloaded the page before saving, the save could fail with an "agent not found" error.

## Improvements

- Codebase-wide quality pass: the project's automated code checks were expanded from a small hand-picked set to the linter's full recommended set, and roughly 1,600 findings were resolved across the codebase. Most were stylistic, but the sweep also corrected a few real issues, including timestamps recorded without a timezone in the autonomous task scheduler and the DeFi Llama market-data client, and error logs that repeated the same error text twice. Failure-case tests were tightened to verify the specific error they expect instead of accepting any failure.
- Removed an unused third-party dependency, slightly reducing install size.

# Release v2.31.1

## Improvements

- Clearer diagnostics for model provider failures: when a model provider rejects or fails a request, error logs and alerts now include the provider's status code and response details, instead of only a generic message like "Provider returned error". This applies to agent runs and to background history summarization, and makes it possible to tell at a glance whether a failure was a provider outage or a rejected request.

# Release v2.31.0

## Agent Form Rebuilt

The agent creation and editing form has been rebuilt. It used to be generated from a schema the backend served; it is now written directly in the web app. That removes a layer of indirection that made every form change a two-sided edit, and it lets the create page render immediately instead of waiting on the server.

**What you'll notice**

- Fields are grouped into **Basic**, **LLM** and **Tools** sections rather than one long list.
- Clearing a field while editing an agent — emptying the system prompt, deselecting every tool, or returning reasoning effort to the model default — now saves correctly. These previously reported success but kept the old value.
- The form no longer rejects names, slugs or prompts that the service actually accepts.

A new endpoint serves the tool catalogue to any client that needs to build a tool picker.

## Claude Opus 5

Agents can now run on **Claude Opus 5**, at the same price as Opus 4.8. Agents set to Opus 4.8 move over automatically and need no changes. Two long-standing errors in the Opus entry were also corrected — its maximum response length was understated by a wide margin, and file attachments were listed as unsupported when they work.

## Performance

- Startup is faster: agent definitions are now parsed with a native library, cutting that step from roughly 44ms to 2ms, and the work has been moved off the main request loop.
- Several operations that could briefly block the service during startup and shutdown no longer do.

## Maintenance

- Python dependencies refreshed across the board, including the Redis client's first major release in some time. Connection timeouts are now set explicitly so the upgrade changes no behaviour.
- Long-standing structural issues in the core module were resolved, restoring a clean bill of health from the project's static analysis and linting suite for the first time since mid-July.
- Log records now identify which tool produced them; previously every tool logged under a shared name.
- Fixed bugs in the activity notification, tool logging and agent configuration modules, and removed several pieces of dead code.

# Release v2.30.1

## Improvements

- Refreshed all frontend dependencies to their latest compatible versions, including security patches: the image-processing library behind photo optimization was upgraded past several known vulnerabilities, and the dependency flaw flagged on the repository (a denial-of-service issue in a build-time tool) is resolved.
- The management UI now runs on the latest Next.js and React patch releases for improved stability.

# Release v2.30.0

## New Features

- Upgraded the Gemini model lineup: Gemini 3.6 Flash replaces Gemini 3.5 Flash as the default flash-tier model, and Gemini 3.5 Flash Lite replaces Gemini 3.1 Flash Lite as the lite-tier model. Both are available natively and via OpenRouter, and agents using the previous models switch over automatically — no configuration change needed.
- Pricing follows the new models: Gemini 3.6 Flash produces output about 17% cheaper than its predecessor, while Gemini 3.5 Flash Lite costs slightly more than the old lite model (still the budget tier). Public agent templates and built-in web search now run on Gemini 3.6 Flash.

## Improvements

- Streamlined the agent management UI: the agent creation and editing pages now share one consistent form, and unused frontend code was removed for a lighter build.
- Internal cleanup of legacy compatibility code, one-off migration scripts, and orphaned modules left over from earlier refactors.

# Release v2.29.0

## Improvements

- Simplified the agent lifecycle: creating or updating an agent simply takes effect immediately. The leftover "deploy" wording from an older draft-based workflow is gone from agent tools, messages, and notifications, so assistants describe changes the way they actually work.
- An agent's "last updated" time now reflects real edits only — routine background refreshes such as hourly account snapshots and asset caches no longer count. This keeps the Team Lead's view of recently active agents meaningful and avoids unnecessary periodic reinitialization of busy agents.
- Internal cleanup of legacy code and a leftover database column from the retired draft system; the database schema updates itself automatically on upgrade.

# Release v2.28.1

## Improvements

- When the Team Lead decides which agent should handle a request, it now considers the most recently updated agents first, so the agents you actively maintain stay front of mind on large teams.
- Brand-new teams get a cleaner experience: the Team Lead now clearly knows the team has no agents yet, instead of looking for a roster that isn't there.

# Release v2.28.0

## Improvements

- The Team Lead is now a noticeably more capable and proactive assistant. It understands how your team and its agents fit together, sees your team's own agents at a glance so it can hand a request straight to the right one, and takes ownership of your goal from start to finish rather than passing work off and stopping. When it delegates a task to another agent it now carries over the full context and relays any follow-up question back to you, so multi-step requests move along more smoothly.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where a recent change to an agent's name or description could take a while to be reflected when the Team Lead was choosing which agent to hand a task to. Such edits now show up right away.

# Release v2.27.4

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed web-enabled agents on OpenRouter models stalling mid-task. Certain models would occasionally emit their internal tool-call instructions as visible text instead of actually running the tool, leaving the task unfinished. These agents now use our own web search and page-reading tools, which run reliably across every model, so multi-step research and publishing flows complete as expected.

# Release v2.27.3

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed a crash on the agent chat page ("Failed to load agent") that could occur while an agent streamed several updates in quick succession, such as live tool-call status frames. The chat now stays stable through rapid bursts of activity.
- Follow-up messages in the same conversation now stream their replies live from the start; previously the beginning of a second reply could stay hidden until the response finished.

# Release v2.27.2

## Improvements

- More reliable web-enabled agents: when a model's built-in web search or page-fetch briefly fails upstream, or a response is cut off in transit, the request is now retried automatically instead of surfacing as an error. Genuinely permanent failures — such as an exhausted usage limit — still stop right away, so real problems stay visible.
- Routine maintenance: refreshed the underlying software dependencies to their latest compatible versions.

# Release v2.27.1

## Improvements

- Smarter image storage: when an agent tries to persist an image that is already hosted on our CDN (for example, one it just generated), the existing link is now returned directly instead of downloading and uploading a duplicate copy. This eliminates wasted transfers and duplicate files in storage.

# Release v2.27.0

## New Features

- Kimi K3 is now available: Moonshot's new flagship model with a 1M-token context window, image understanding, and deep reasoning, served exclusively through Moonshot's own infrastructure for consistent quality.

## Improvements

- Agents still configured with the older Kimi models (K2.6 and K2.7 Code) are automatically upgraded to Kimi K3 — no configuration change needed. K3 always reasons deeply before answering, so replies may be more thorough, and usage is billed at the new model's rates.

# Release v2.26.3

## Improvements

- Fixed GPT image generation when running through OpenRouter: requests now go to the correct image endpoint, so `image_gpt` and `image_gpt_mini` work again without a native OpenAI key.
- Publishing posts is more forgiving: an overlong URL slug no longer fails the whole request — it is now shortened automatically at a word boundary.

# Release v2.26.2

## Improvements

- Significantly cheaper scheduled tasks: fixed an issue in the autonomous task module where each step of a run was billed as if the whole conversation were new, instead of reusing the AI provider's prompt cache. Long multi-step runs now cost a fraction of what they did, with no change in behavior.

# Release v2.26.1

## Improvements

- More resilient replies: temporary AI provider hiccups — dropped connections, timeouts, rate limits, brief outages — are now retried automatically, including interruptions that happen midway through generating a response. When a request truly cannot be completed, the conversation now shows a proper error notice instead of occasionally recording the raw failure as if it were the agent's reply.
- Faster long conversations: removed an ineffective context-trimming layer that added overhead to every reply and reduced caching efficiency in long threads. Long-history management is now handled entirely by the tiered history compression.

# Release v2.26.0

## Improvements

- Task planning now runs only in live conversations, matching the interactive UI tools. Scheduled (cron) runs no longer build todo lists — they are single-shot and carry facts between runs via task memory — and delegated sub-agent runs keep leaving planning to the agent you are talking to. Chats with a real user watching keep the live checklist exactly as before.

# Release v2.25.0

## New Features

- **Reasoning effort per agent**: agents can now set how much thinking their model does before answering — from none up to max — right next to the model choice. Leave it unset to use the model's recommended default. The setting automatically adapts to each model's real capabilities: models that can't turn thinking off run at their lightest level, and models with a simple on/off switch map your choice sensibly. The team lead can also configure this when creating or updating agents.

## Improvements

- **Model lineup cleanup**: retired the MiniMax M2 Her and Grok 4.20 models. Agents still using them switch automatically to MiniMax M3 and Grok 4.5 (Grok 4.5 is the newer model despite the smaller version number).
- Fixed an issue where MiniMax M3 connected directly was not using its thinking mode.

# Release v2.24.0

## Improvements

- **Task planning is now built in for every agent**: the per-agent "todo" toggle is gone. All agents — including the team lead — plan complex multi-step requests automatically, while delegated sub-agent runs still skip planning (the plan belongs to the agent you are talking to).
- Removed the automatic tool picker that kicked in for agents with a very large tool list; agents now always work with their full set of tools directly.

## Notes for operators

- Predefined public agents will report a one-time "updated" during the next sync — their content fingerprint changed with the removed setting. No action needed.

# Release v2.23.0

## Improvements

- **Models now run on provider-recommended settings**: manual tuning knobs (temperature and repetition penalties) are retired across agents and templates. Current-generation models are optimized for their providers' defaults — several reject or silently ignore manual values — so every model now runs the way its maker intended, with no configuration needed.
- **Smarter reasoning control for DeepSeek**: DeepSeek models now switch thinking mode on or off exactly as configured, so the fast variant responds quicker and no longer spends hidden reasoning effort.
- Fixed an invalid reasoning setting on the GPT-5.6 Luna model.

# Release v2.22.0

## New Features

- **Nano Banana 2 Lite image model**: added Google's fastest and most affordable image generator to the image toolset — ideal for quick drafts and high-volume image workflows, at about half the price of Nano Banana 2.

## Improvements

- **Grok video upgraded to Imagine Video 1.5**: xAI's latest video model delivers steadier motion with clearer, better-synced speech and sound.
- **Gemini image models moved to stable versions**: Nano Banana Pro, Nano Banana 2, and agent avatar generation now run on Google's production model releases instead of previews.
- The China A-Share toolset now shows its own icon in the tool picker.
- Fixed a performance issue where generating a Gemini image could briefly stall other conversations on the same server.

# Release v2.21.0

## New Features

- **Smarter conversation memory**: long conversations are now compressed with a new in-house strategy that adapts to how active the chat is. Active conversations keep as much context as possible (and stay prompt-cache friendly); a chat resumed after hours or days is compacted more aggressively, cutting input cost and speeding up the first reply.
- **Compression that keeps what matters**: instead of blindly trimming old messages, the agent now preserves the conversation's opening exchange and the most recent round in full, and replaces everything in between with an AI-written summary — so the agent still remembers how the conversation started and what was just said.
- **Per-model tuning**: the compression thresholds (for active, recent, and idle conversations) can now be adjusted per model in the model catalog, with sensible defaults derived from each model's context window.

## Improvements

- Extremely long histories are now summarized reliably in stages, even when they exceed the summarizer model's own capacity.
- A failed summarization no longer risks corrupting conversation history — the agent simply keeps the full history and retries later.
- Fixed issues in the history compression module that could cause repeated re-summarization of the same conversation.

# Release v2.20.0

## New Features

- **Task planning rebuilt**: agents with the todo feature enabled now reliably maintain a working plan for complex, multi-step requests. Plans stay accurate through very long conversations (the agent no longer loses sight of its list when older context is compacted away), a finished task's list is cleaned up automatically so it never leaks into the next request, and prompt-cache efficiency is preserved throughout.
- **Visible plans everywhere**: web chat renders the plan as a live checklist with per-step states and a progress count. IM channels (Telegram, WeChat, Slack, Lark) show the checklist when a plan is created and a compact one-line progress note as steps complete.

## Improvements

- Fixed bugs in the todo module that could leave the planning tool entirely unavailable to the agent.
- Sub-agent runs no longer carry their own todo lists — planning stays with the agent you are talking to. Scheduled (cron) runs keep full planning support.

# Release v2.19.0

## New Features

- **Memory page**: a new "Memory" entry in the account area shows what your agents remember, split into Team Memory (shared with the whole team) and Your Memory (what each agent remembers about you personally). Entries are shown truncated — open one to read the full text rendered as Markdown, or edit it directly. Memories are managed automatically by your agents, so you normally don't need to read or change them. Available in both the bundled frontend and the team frontend.
- **Memory API**: new endpoints to list and edit these memory documents (`/teams/{team_id}/memories` in the Team API, `/memories` in the local API), with size limits and per-user access control.

## Improvements

- **Long-term memory is always on**: memory now belongs to the conversation (team, user, channel, or cron task), not the agent, so the per-agent "Long-Term Memory" switch is gone. Agents skip the memory tool automatically in the few situations where it cannot work (sub-agent runs and anonymous visitors).
- **Super mode removed**: every agent now runs with the higher execution step limit by default, so the per-agent "Super Mode" switch and badge are gone. The limit can still be tuned server-wide.
- The lead agent's memory page entry shows the lead's real configured name and avatar.
- Fixed minor issues in prompt assembly and memory loading performance.

# Release v2.18.0

## New Features

- **One System Prompt**: the five separate prompt fields (Purpose, Personality, Principles, Knowledge Base, Advanced) are merged into a single "System Prompt" written in Markdown. It holds up to 200,000 characters and supports level-2+ headings, so you can structure the agent's role, personality, rules, and knowledge in one place, your way. Existing agents are migrated automatically — their old fields are stitched into the new prompt under matching section headings.
- **Description is a first-class field**: the short public description is now edited right in the agent form instead of only through the publish flow. It appears in agent listings and search, and it is what other agents read when they delegate work to this one as a sub-agent. Agents that never set a description automatically inherit their old Purpose text.
- **Team lead upgrades**: the lead's agent manager creates and updates agents with the new single system prompt and can set the description too, and its agent listings show the description consistently.

## Improvements

- All built-in public seed agents were converted to the new single-prompt format.
- Avatar generation now handles very large prompts gracefully.
- Internal cleanup of prompt assembly and validation logic.

# Release v2.17.0

## New Features

- **All crypto tools under one roof**: the "Web3 Tools" section in the agent form now covers the entire crypto domain — market data, on-chain analytics, DeFi dashboards, and crypto news (Moralis, Dexscreener, CoinGecko, Dune, DeFiLlama, and more) join the wallet-operating tools there, instead of being scattered through the general tool list.
- **Smarter wallet requirements**: only tools that actually operate on a team wallet still require the team to own one. Read-only crypto data and analytics tools no longer trigger wallet checks, no longer block wallet deletion, and no longer add wallet instructions to the agent's prompt.

## Improvements

- Internal cleanup of an unused agent editing flow and legacy migration scripts.

# Release v2.16.0

## Improvements

- **Clearer model picker**: every model in the selection list now shows its provider as a small gray label on the right, and the selected model's provider is displayed in the closed selector too. The floating provider headers that could blend into the list while scrolling are gone.
- The collapsed web3 toolset group in the agent form is now titled "Web3 Tools", matching what it actually contains.

# Release v2.15.0

## New Features

- **Latest AI models**: the model catalog now offers the newest generation across providers — OpenAI GPT-5.6 (Sol, Terra, and Luna tiers), xAI Grok 4.5, Claude Sonnet 5, Qwen3.7 Plus, and GLM 5.2 — with up-to-date pricing and capability data.
- **Seamless model upgrades**: retired models are now automatically routed to their successors. Existing agents configured with an older model keep working without any reconfiguration and transparently benefit from the newer model.
- **Official model providers**: requests routed through OpenRouter are now pinned to each model's first-party provider, ensuring consistent quality and behavior.

## Improvements

- Each model series now keeps a single, current version in the catalog, making model selection simpler.
- Agents created from the built-in templates and public agent gallery now use the latest models.
- Fixed inaccurate pricing data and unavailable model identifiers in the model catalog module.

# Release v2.14.1

## Improvements

- Fixed a database upgrade from the previous release that could fail to start the background services — including scheduled autonomous tasks — on deployments whose database was missing certain optional tables. The schema upgrade now applies safely regardless of which of those tables a database already has.

# Release v2.14.0

## New Features

- Networks now follow wallets. Each team wallet carries its own default network, editable on the wallet page (Safe and Privy smart wallets stay on the chain they were deployed on). On-chain tools automatically operate on the network of the wallet they are called with, so one agent can work across several chains through different wallets. The agent-level network setting has been removed.
- The agent create and edit forms are leaner: the model tuning parameters are gone, and all web3 toolsets are grouped under a collapsed "Advanced Settings" section that only appears when the team owns a wallet.

## Improvements

- Toolset rows in the agent form show a compact selected/total counter, and the toolset description expands together with the toolset.
- The wallet management API's rename endpoint became a general update endpoint covering the name and the default network, with validation of the allowed networks.
- Reduced redundant database lookups in the on-chain tool layer and fixed bugs in the OpenSea listing tools.

# Release v2.13.0

## New Features

- Tool calls now report their status the moment they start. The chat stream sends a live frame as soon as the agent begins a tool call, so the web UI shows the agent's status line with a spinner right away — expanding a running call reveals its request parameters, and when the call finishes, the result folds into the same badge.
- Telegram, WeChat, Slack, and Lark conversations get the status message at the start of the tool call instead of after it finished, so users see what the agent is doing while it works.

## Improvements

- Cancelled or interrupted conversations clean up their leftover "running" indicators automatically, and conversation history stays exactly as before — the live frames are never stored.
- Fixed small inconsistencies in how non-streaming API responses assembled their message lists.

# Release v2.12.0

## New Features

- Agents now narrate their tool use. Every tool call carries a short status line written by the agent in the user's own language — for example "Searching the web for the latest BTC news" — and the chat shows that line instead of the raw tool name. Expanding a tool call still reveals the tool name, parameters, and response for troubleshooting.
- Telegram and WeChat conversations benefit too: the "Running tool..." notice now shows the agent's own description of what it is doing, and when several tools run at once, each one gets its own line.

## Improvements

- Older messages and tools without a status line keep the previous display, so existing conversations look the same as before.

# Release v2.11.0

## New Features

- Linkable apps grew from 4 to 16: alongside Twitter/X, Notion, Gmail, and Supabase, teams can now link Outlook, Google Calendar, Google Docs, Sheets, Slides and Drive, LinkedIn, Airtable, Linear, GitHub, Jira, and Stripe.
- Links now come in two levels. Team-level apps (GitHub, Notion, Stripe, and the rest) are linked once by an admin and shared by the whole team. Personal apps (Gmail, Outlook, Google Calendar, LinkedIn) are linked by each member for themselves — when the team lead agent talks to you, it acts on your own accounts, never a teammate's.
- Every app carries category tags, and the Links page gained a search box and category filters, so the bigger catalog stays easy to navigate.

## Improvements

- The Links page is more compact: linking moved into each card's header, cards flow in a responsive grid, and apps are grouped into Personal and Team sections.
- Personal accounts stay private — the page and the agent only ever see your own personal links; other members' accounts are invisible, even to admins.
- Opening the Links page now refreshes the status of every linked account in the team, so an account that expired or was revoked shows up (and stops being used) sooner.
- Fixed bugs in the linking flow and made permission errors clearer.

# Release v2.10.0

## New Features

- Rich UI components (cards and clickable choice options) are now a built-in ability of every agent — nothing to enable in the tool picker anymore. Agents show them automatically wherever someone is actually watching the conversation: the web app, API clients, Telegram, WeChat, Lark, and Slack. Scheduled background runs and agent-to-agent delegation deliberately skip them, since there is no live user to click anything there.

## Improvements

- WeChat now displays card images as real pictures instead of dropping them; the rest of the card follows as text, which is the richest form WeChat's bot messaging supports.
- Existing agents that had the UI components selected keep working unchanged — old configurations are accepted and tidied up automatically.

# Release v2.9.0

## New Features

- Scoped long-term memory: an agent now keeps separate memory documents for the team using it, for each individual user it talks to, for each channel thread (Telegram, Slack, Lark, WeChat), and for each scheduled task — all maintained through a single memory tool. When different teams talk to the same public agent, each team's memory stays completely private to them.
- Team wallet management: wallets can now be renamed and deleted, and Safe wallets' token spending limits adjusted, through new admin APIs. Deleting a team's last wallet is refused while agents still have on-chain tools configured, so an agent can never be left stranded.
- Guests talking to a published agent now get its full read-side abilities — recent posts and activities, sub-agent delegation, on-chain data lookups, and personal memory — while publishing content, signing transactions, and anything else that acts with the agent's identity stays strictly reserved for the owning team, enforced both when tools are offered and again when they execute.
- Publishing rules now keep delegation consistent: an agent can only be published when every sub-agent it uses is public too, and an agent that a public agent depends on cannot be hidden, archived, or deleted while the reference stands.

## Improvements

- Scheduled (autonomous) tasks no longer carry conversation history between runs. Every run starts fresh — dramatically cutting token costs for long-lived tasks — and tasks record the facts they need across runs in their own task memory instead.
- All costs incurred by delegated sub-agent work are billed to the account that started the conversation, no matter how deep the delegation chain goes.
- The tool catalog is now derived directly from the code instead of separate schema files, so tool pickers, validation, and the agent's own tool listing can never drift apart; toolsets that need a team wallet are now correctly hidden for teams without one.
- Fixed bugs in the tool availability and agent visibility modules.

# Release v2.8.0

## New Features

- Agents now always know which channel a conversation originally came from (web, Telegram, WeChat, Lark, Slack, or a scheduled task), even when the work is delegated through one or more sub-agents. Channel-specific behavior such as formatting rules now applies correctly to delegated agents at any depth.
- Agents are now explicitly aware when they run as a sub-agent on behalf of another agent, and adjust their behavior accordingly — for example, sub-agents spawned by an autonomous task know they must complete the work without asking the user for input.

## Improvements

- Observability: traces are now labeled with the real entry channel instead of a generic internal marker, and delegated runs carry a dedicated sub-agent flag, making it much easier to filter and analyze multi-agent conversations.
- Chat history records for delegated runs are now consistently attributed to the originating channel.

# Release v2.7.2

## Improvements

- Updated third-party dependencies across the whole platform — backend, web console, and channel integrations — including fixes for two security advisories in underlying libraries.
- Picked up upstream AI framework updates that improve tool-calling reliability across model providers and make conversation state handling more robust.

# Release v2.7.1

## Improvements

- Database schema upgrades now run automatically when services start — deploying a new version no longer requires any manual migration step. Existing databases are adopted in place on their first start after this release, several services starting at the same time coordinate safely, and a service will refuse to start on a database it could not upgrade rather than run with a mismatched schema.

# Release v2.7.0

## New Features

- Links: teams can now connect external app accounts — Twitter/X, Notion, Gmail, and Supabase — and the team lead agent gains the ability to act through them: read and send email, post to X, work with Notion pages, manage Supabase projects, and more. Connecting an account is always a standard OAuth authorization (users never copy API keys), accounts can be unlinked at any time, and when someone asks about an app that isn't linked yet, the lead points them to the Links page. Available in both the team API and the local single-user deployment.
- Channels: Slack and Lark/Feishu join the team channel lineup — a team admin authorizes the official app into their own workspace with a single click. Telegram now runs through one official shared bot that groups join via a bind link, so teams no longer manage their own bot tokens.

## Improvements

- Database schema changes are now managed with Alembic migrations, making upgrades safer and more repeatable.
- Release builds now ship ready-to-run images for the Lark and Slack channel services.

# Release v2.6.9

## Improvements

- Team conversations are now private to each member. When working with a team agent, you see only your own chat threads, message history, and tool activity; conversations belonging to other team members are no longer shown or accessible. The shared default notification channel remains visible to the whole team.

# Release v2.6.8

## Improvements

- Streamlined observability: agent run tracing now relies on a single platform (Langfuse). Support for the alternative tracing backend was removed to simplify configuration and reduce ongoing maintenance. No user-facing changes.

# Release v2.6.7

## New Features

- Chat conversations now show friendly time markers between messages: a small timestamp appears after a pause or when the day changes (for example "Yesterday 15:12"), and hovering over a message's avatar reveals its exact time.

# Release v2.6.6

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed a billing issue in agent-to-agent delegation: when an agent handed a task off to another agent, the cost of that delegated work was not charged back to the team paying for the conversation (and, with billing enabled, could even prevent the delegated task from running). Delegated work is now correctly billed to the caller's account.

# Release v2.6.5

## Improvements

- Maintenance release: refreshed dependencies across the whole platform — the Python backend, the Go channel integrations, and the web frontend — to their latest compatible versions, with the internal code adjustments needed to stay current with those libraries. No user-facing changes.

# Release v2.6.4

## Improvements

- Observability traces (Langfuse) now show a readable name — the agent's name and its owning team — instead of the raw agent id, and carry richer filterable details: agent and team display names, the caller's team for public agents (with an external-caller flag), visibility, and tags. No user-facing changes.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed the test suite still sending traces to the observability backend (Langfuse): the earlier fix was undone by environment reloading, so test/local data kept appearing. Tests now reliably emit nothing.

# Release v2.6.3

## Improvements

- Observability traces (Langfuse) now record a more accurate per-request cost: when the provider reports the actual charge (e.g. OpenRouter) it is used directly, otherwise the cost is computed from the model catalog — and cached input tokens are now priced at their discounted rate instead of being undercounted. No user-facing changes.

# Release v2.6.2

## Improvements

- Internal plumbing only, no user-facing changes: added a cached team display-info lookup (team name/avatar) for read-time enrichment, and ensured the automated test suite no longer sends observability traces to Langfuse.

# Release v2.6.1

## New Features

- Added Moonshot Kimi K2.7 Code, a coding-focused model, to the list of selectable LLM models.

# Release v2.6.0

## New Features

- LLM models served through OpenRouter can now be pinned to a specific upstream provider. When a model defines an origin provider it is locked to that provider with no automatic fallback; models without one continue to let OpenRouter choose. This gives operators precise control over which upstream serves each OpenRouter model.

## Improvements

- The catalog of available LLM models is now defined in a single, easy-to-edit configuration file, replacing the previous comma-separated format and making it simpler to add, adjust, and annotate models.
- Streamlined how model information is sourced: the bundled catalog is now the single source of truth, the unused database-override path was removed, and model lookups are served entirely from memory — removing unnecessary database and cache round-trips.

# Release v2.5.1

## Improvements

- The team lead assistant now runs on a newer, more capable model (Gemini 3.5 Flash), improving the quality of its conversations and its delegation to team agents. Individual team agents are unaffected.

# Release v2.5.0

## New Features

- Added Langfuse as an observability option alongside the existing LangSmith integration. Each deployment chooses a tracing service through its configuration: when Langfuse credentials are provided it is used automatically and LangSmith is turned off; otherwise LangSmith continues to be used. This makes it easy to evaluate both services and settle on the one that fits best.

# Release v2.4.2

## Improvements

- MCP-based tool integrations (such as CoinGecko) are now configured with a single per-service control instead of a long per-tool list, and always expose whatever the remote service currently offers. There is no longer any need to re-sync when a provider changes its tools.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where MCP-based tools could silently stop working after the remote provider changed its set of available tools.

# Release v2.4.1

## Improvements

- WeChat agents can now reply using rich Markdown formatting — headings, bold and strikethrough text, bulleted (including nested) and numbered lists, blockquotes, links, inline code, code blocks, tables and dividers — instead of plain text only, making their replies clearer and easier to read.

# Release v2.4.0

## New Features

- The package can now be installed with optional extras: `intentkit[pdf]` adds PDF generation support and `intentkit[ollama]` adds local Ollama model support, so deployments that don't need them stay lean.

## Improvements

- Internal architecture cleanup: the codebase now enforces a strict module layering, and the agent execution engine was reorganized into smaller, focused modules. Behavior and public APIs are unchanged.
- The dependency list was tidied — unused packages removed and previously implicit ones now declared explicitly — for more reliable and reproducible installs.
- Stronger automated quality gates (type checking, architecture-layer rules, dependency hygiene) and broader continuous-integration coverage now span the Python, Go and frontend code.
- The DeFi Llama tool test suite was moved out of the shipped package and rewritten, so the published library no longer carries test files.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed bugs in the tool integration module: external MCP-wrapped tools now send the correct tool name to remote servers, the Jupiter price and quote tools now honor their per-agent enable/disable settings, the Venice image-enhance tool can now be enabled, and the DeFi Llama price-chart tool now returns data instead of an empty result.

# Release v2.3.1

## Improvements

- LangSmith tracing settings are now managed by the system configuration: values can come from environment variables or the AWS secret, the trace project name defaults to "intentkit", and stray legacy tracing variables in the deployment can no longer flip the tracing switch.
- Configuration values accidentally wrapped in quotes (a common mistake in docker environment blocks) are now sanitized automatically for all settings.

# Release v2.3.0

## New Features

- LangSmith tracing support: agent conversation runs now carry filterable metadata — environment, agent, team, user, channel, conversation thread, app and model — so all deployments can share a single LangSmith project and still be filtered by any of these dimensions. Multi-turn conversations are grouped in the LangSmith Threads view. Chat title generation calls are tagged and named as well. Tracing stays off unless the standard LangSmith environment variables are set on the server.

## Improvements

- Test runs never send traces to LangSmith, even when tracing is enabled in the developer's local environment.

# Release v2.2.0

## New Features

- Agent display info (name, avatar, slug) is now resolved when content is read, backed by a shared Redis cache with a one-day TTL. Posts, activities, the team feed, post PDFs and push notifications always show the agent's current name and avatar; renaming an agent or changing its avatar propagates to all services immediately.
- Autonomous task responses include the target agent's display info (`target_agent`), so clients can render the pinned agent as name + avatar + link instead of a raw ID. The frontend task pages do exactly that.

## Breaking Changes

- The denormalized `agent_name`/`agent_picture` snapshot columns on `agent_posts` and `agent_activities` are dropped automatically at startup. The historical publish-time snapshots are discarded; content now always reflects the agent's current profile.

## Upgrade Notes

- Deploy all backend services together for this release: instances of the previous version fail to read or publish posts/activities once the snapshot columns are dropped.

# Release v2.1.2

## Improvements

- Existing tasks are now moved to team ownership automatically when the autonomous service starts — no manual migration step per environment. The import is skipped once tasks are present; if it cannot run yet, the service retries every minute and raises a single alert.
- The migration now tolerates malformed legacy task data instead of failing as a whole.

# Release v2.1.1

## Improvements

- WeChat push messages that cannot be delivered because the recipient has been inactive too long are now treated as an expected condition and skipped quietly, instead of triggering system error alerts.

# Release v2.1.0

## New Features

- Autonomous tasks now belong to the team instead of a single agent. A task can target a specific agent, or leave the choice to the team lead, which delegates each run to the right agent.
- Every task run is now recorded as an execution: status, how it was triggered, duration, token and credit usage, and a result preview, with the complete per-run log available from the new task detail page.
- Tasks can be started on demand with the new "Run Now" action, in addition to their schedule.
- A new task-manager assistant under the team lead handles tasks in conversation: create, edit, retarget, or remove scheduled tasks by simply asking the lead.
- Tasks record who created them.

## Improvements

- Overlapping runs of the same task are prevented automatically, and runs orphaned by a service restart are cleaned up on the next run.
- The scheduler process is leaner: agent and lead executions are routed to the core service instead of running inside the scheduler.
- Fixed the long-standing issue where task logs could not be viewed; logs are now reliably available per run.

## Upgrade Notes

- After deploying, run `python scripts/migrate_autonomous_to_team.py` once to move existing per-agent tasks to their teams. The script is idempotent; agents without a team are skipped with a warning. The legacy task data on agents is kept for this release and will be removed in the next one.

# Release v2.0.5

## New Features

- Team leads can now browse public agents from other teams, follow the useful ones, and delegate tasks to them just like in-team agents.

## Improvements

- The team lead now knows to hand off post and activity publishing to the right agents instead of doing everything itself.
- Smarter model selection guidance when the lead creates or updates agents.
- Channel connectivity incidents (WeChat and Telegram) now trigger a single consolidated alert with a follow-up when service recovers, instead of a flood of repeated error messages; reconnection attempts also back off more patiently during longer outages.

# Release v2.0.4

## Bug Fixes

- Downloaded post PDFs no longer include the cover image, keeping the exported document consistent with the post and shared pages.

## Improvements

- Removed a deprecated internal utility that was no longer in use, trimming the codebase with no change to existing behavior.

# Release v2.0.3

## Improvements

- Removed a superseded internal agent-management component that had already been fully replaced by the team lead experience, trimming the codebase with no change to existing behavior.
- Made agent creation and editing a little faster by reusing the cached catalog of available tools instead of rebuilding it on every request.

# Release v2.0.2

## Improvements

- Reduced noisy error alerts from the WeChat integration. Brief connection hiccups that recover on their own — common in the first moments after a restart — are no longer reported as errors; only sustained connection problems are escalated, making genuine issues easier to spot.

# Release v2.0.1

## Improvements

- Upgraded locked dependencies across the backend and the web frontend to their current upstream releases.
- Resolved all outstanding security advisories reported for backend and frontend dependencies.
- Removed unused legacy packages left over from the move to the standalone messaging adapters, reducing the install footprint.

# Release v2.0.0

## Improvements

- The platform's "skill" concept has been renamed to "tool" everywhere — in agent configuration, the API, and stored data — to align with standard agent terminology and make room for the upcoming Agent Skills capability. What used to be called a skill is now a tool, and skill categories are now "toolsets".
- Existing agents, conversation history, and billing records are upgraded automatically the first time the updated service starts, so upgrading requires no manual migration steps.

# Release v1.2.18

## New Features

- Agents running on models without a built-in web search (such as DeepSeek and MiniMax) now have reliable Internet Search. It draws on several search providers behind the scenes and automatically falls back to another whenever one is unavailable or out of quota, so searches keep succeeding without any manual switching.

## Improvements

- Web search is now delivered through a single, consistent built-in capability for these models; the standalone Tavily skill has been retired and its functionality folded into the unified search.

# Release v1.2.17

## New Features

- Agents now report the current time together with a numeric Unix timestamp, so tools and workflows that need an exact machine-readable time value can use it directly.

## Improvements

- Agents running on OpenRouter models with Internet Search enabled can now read full web pages natively, on top of searching — giving more complete and reliable answers when they need details from a specific page.
- Made timekeeping consistent across every agent: all models now use the same built-in time tool, so the time format and behavior no longer depend on the underlying model provider.

# Release v1.2.16

## New Features

- Shared posts can now be downloaded as a styled PDF directly from their public share page, so a post can be saved or printed without signing in.
- Expanded the available AI model lineup: added Qwen3.7 Max, Qwen3.6 Flash, and MiniMax M3, and upgraded Claude Opus to version 4.8.

## Improvements

- Strengthened safeguards on the PDF rendering service so it can no longer be tricked into fetching internal or restricted network addresses.
- Bumped locked dependencies to current upstream releases.

# Release v1.2.15

## New Features

- Agents with Internet Search enabled can now save external images to our CDN so the links stay valid in long-form output. When an agent is writing an article or post and wants to embed an image it found online, it can persist the image to our storage and reference it via a permanent CDN URL — protecting against broken images later when the source site rotates or removes the original asset. The capability is available across every supported LLM provider.

# Release v1.2.14

## Improvements

- Activity links pushed into WeChat can now be served through a separate CDN domain for faster in-app loading. When `WECHAT_BASE_URL` is configured, share links inside WeChat messages are rewritten from the canonical app domain to the CDN domain at send time. Other channels (Telegram), persisted chat history, and frontend responses continue to use the canonical app domain unchanged.
- Bumped locked dependencies to current upstream releases.

# Release v1.2.13

## Improvements

- Added Google's newly released Gemini 3.5 Flash to the model catalog, available via both the Google native key and OpenRouter. The model offers stronger reasoning than the Gemini 3 Flash tier while keeping the full 1M-token context, native image / audio / video / PDF inputs, and Flash-class latency, giving team agents a new mid-tier multimodal option.
- Refreshed DeepSeek's official pricing to reflect DeepSeek's current promotional discount: DeepSeek V4 Pro on the official key is now 75% off (running through 2026-05-31), and the cache-hit input rate on DeepSeek V4 Flash drops to one tenth of its launch price. Agents that route through the DeepSeek native key automatically benefit from the lower rates. OpenRouter routes for the same models are unaffected.
- Bumped locked dependencies to current upstream releases.

# Release v1.2.12

## Improvements

- Long agent conversations now cost less to persist. Checkpoint storage for chat history switches from a full per-step snapshot to incremental writes, so the same conversation that previously grew its database footprint quadratically with the number of turns now grows linearly. For threads that run dozens of turns, this is a meaningful reduction in both Postgres write volume and total stored bytes; existing threads continue to work without migration.
- Conversations on Anthropic models (Claude family) now use Anthropic's native prompt caching for the system prompt and tool definitions. For agents with long instructions or many tools — which is most of our team agents — this can cut input-token cost by 50-90% on repeated turns within a 5-minute cache window, without changing model behavior.
- Refreshed all LangChain and LangGraph dependency floors to match the actual installed 1.x lockfile, so new installs no longer risk resolving to versions that pre-date the agent and middleware framework we already rely on.

# Release v1.2.11

## Improvements

- Added a new `cn_stock` skill package that surfaces Chinese A-share market data (Shanghai / Shenzhen / Beijing exchanges) to agents through nine tools backed by the `akshare` library: real-time spot quote, K-line history, major-index snapshot with optional 30-day history, industry/concept board snapshots ranked by intraday change, capital flow for an individual stock or the whole market, stock-specific or macro financial news, the day's listed-company announcements, fundamental financial metrics by reporting period, and a trading-day calendar gate for scheduled tasks. All akshare calls are dispatched off the event loop via `asyncio.to_thread`, share a category-level 60/min global rate limit, and use short-TTL Redis caching (10s for live quotes, up to 24h for the trading calendar) to absorb retry storms against akshare's free public endpoints. Stock codes accept any of the common formats (`600519`, `sh600519`, `SH600519`, `600519.SH`) and are normalized internally; the BSE `920xxx` prefix introduced in 2025 is correctly classified as Beijing without sweeping in `900xxx` SSE B-shares. Defaults for "today" use Asia/Shanghai rather than the server's local clock, so an agent running on a UTC host gets the right trading day during the Beijing morning window. Four ready-to-use public agents ship with the package — a market-overview leaf, a quote leaf, a news leaf, and a fundamentals leaf — designed to be composed by a team-built orchestrator via `lead_call_agent`.

## Bug Fixes

- Agent autonomous cron triggers are now pinned to UTC. They were previously created via APScheduler's `CronTrigger.from_crontab` without an explicit timezone, so the cron expression was interpreted in whatever local time the worker process happened to be running in; the same agent's `0 9 * * *` trigger would fire at a different wall-clock instant depending on which environment landed it, and could silently shift across DST transitions on hosts that observe them. The new triggers explicitly use UTC, matching the heartbeat trigger already in the same file, so schedules are stable and reproducible across environments.

# Release v1.2.10

## Improvements

- The flagship OpenAI image-generation skill now uses the newly released GPT Image 2 model in place of GPT Image 1.5. GPT Image 2 produces higher-quality images and follows prompts more accurately. The per-call price is increased to reflect the new model's higher cost — about 1.5x the previous price at default quality.

# Release v1.2.9

## Improvements

- The lead-agent's `lead_get_team_info` skill now also reports the team's public-agent quota usage (`public_agent_limit` and `current_public_agent_count`), so the lead can advise users before they try to publish another agent that would push them over the quota. The two underlying queries (team members + public-agent count) now run in parallel via `asyncio.gather`.
- Added a `publish_agent` skill to the agent-manager so the manager can publish (or republish) the active agent to public on behalf of the user — without asking them to switch to the publish form. The skill collects the four user-visible fields (Description, Example Intro, Examples 1–6, Tags 0–3 from a predefined ~50-category enum) and forces `fee_percentage = 1` server-side; it returns user-friendly messages when the team has reached its public-agent quota, when the agent has no team, or when the agent isn't owned by the current user, so the manager can steer the conversation accordingly. Internally, the tag enum and the four-field input model were promoted out of the team API layer into the canonical model layer (`intentkit/models/agent/tags.py`, `intentkit/models/agent/public_info.py:AgentPublishInput`) so the team-publish endpoint and the new manager skill share a single `AgentPublishInput.to_public_info()` helper, keeping the field set and the fixed `fee_percentage = 1` policy in one place.

# Release v1.2.8

## Improvements

- Simplified the team-version "publish agent to public" flow to the fields the team UI actually needs. The previous form was schema-driven against the full `AgentPublicInfo` model and surfaced every field on it, including the web3-era ticker / token-address / token-pool / external-website / x402-price / fee-percentage controls that are no longer relevant for the team product, and rendered the examples editor through a generic JSON-schema array widget that was awkward to use. The team publish endpoint now accepts only Description (required), Example Intro (required), Examples (required, 1–6 entries with name / description / prompt), and Tags (optional, up to 3 from a predefined ~50-category list spanning productivity, creative, education, lifestyle, entertainment, knowledge, health, companion, business, and tech). Other public-info fields on the agent are left untouched on republish, so any prior values are preserved. `fee_percentage` is now fixed at 1 for every team publish regardless of what the client sends. A new `GET /schema/agent-public-tags` endpoint serves the predefined tag list with module-level caching and an HTTP cache header so the frontend can render the multi-select grouped by category.

# Release v1.2.7

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed Gemini still rejecting requests with an "empty mimeType in inlineData" error even after v1.2.6, when the conversation had any voice/video/file attachments from before v1.2.4. Those earlier turns were stored in chat history without a content type, and Gemini's adapter failed to recover one from the URL alone, so every subsequent reply in that conversation kept failing. The platform now repairs each historical attachment on the fly — guessing the content type from the URL extension and falling back to a per-type default — and drops the attachment when no reasonable type can be determined, so a single bad legacy attachment can no longer poison an entire conversation.

# Release v1.2.6

## Improvements

- Audio, video, and document attachments now reach every model that claims to support them, not just Gemini. The previous release used a Google-specific delivery format and silently blocked the same attachment from reaching, for example, an OpenAI- or OpenRouter-routed model that supports audio. The platform now uses a provider-agnostic delivery shape that LangChain translates into each provider's native format (OpenAI's `input_audio`, Anthropic's `document`, Gemini's `inlineData`, etc.), so the model capability flags configured per model are the single source of truth.

# Release v1.2.5

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed audio, video, and document attachments still failing with an "empty mimeType" error against Gemini, despite v1.2.4. The previous attempt added a content-type hint to the request and relied on the LangChain adapter to fetch the file and pass it through correctly; in production that path still produced empty values. The platform now downloads the file itself before calling the model and hands the bytes plus an explicit content type directly to Gemini, which removes the empty-mimeType failure mode entirely. The content type is derived from the file's HTTP headers, falling back to its extension and a per-type default so it is never empty.

# Release v1.2.4

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed a regression introduced in v1.2.3 where Gemini rejected every audio, video, and document attachment with an "empty mimeType" error before the model ever saw the content. Media attachments are now sent with an explicit content-type hint so the model can actually open them.

# Release v1.2.3

## New Features

- WeChat voice messages now reach audio-capable models as actual audio. Previously, voice notes were uploaded as raw SILK files that no model could read, so the model would just see a URL with a `.silk` extension in the prompt and politely refuse. They are now transcoded to MP3 inside the WeChat integration before upload, then delivered to the model through a proper audio attachment so Gemini (and any other audio-capable model added in the future) can actually listen to them.
- Audio, video, and document attachments now follow the same rules as images. When an attachment type matches the model's capabilities the file is forwarded to the model as a media input; when it does not, the user gets a clear, type-specific message telling them their current model can't accept that kind of input. This replaces the previous behavior where non-image attachments silently turned into a URL embedded in the prompt text.

## Improvements

- Tightened the WeChat attachment summary so a voice message and a separately-attached file are both counted correctly when shown back as a "User sent ..." preview.

# Release v1.2.2

## Improvements

- Streamlined how the team lead delegates to its built-in sub-agents. The "task manager" was folded into the agent manager, since autonomous tasks always belong to an agent. Operators now have a single destination for everything about a team agent — creating it, configuring it, and scheduling its autonomous tasks — which removes a class of routing mistakes the lead used to make between the two near-identical helpers.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where the agent manager could suggest skills that were not actually enabled in the current deployment. The skill catalog shown to the LLM is now filtered against the system configuration, so unavailable categories never end up in a generated agent draft.

## Other

- Refreshed Go integration dependencies.

# Release v1.2.1

## New Features

- Teams can now publish their agents to the public catalog directly from the team UI. Publishing prompts the operator to fill in the agent's public-facing info (description, ticker, example prompts, and so on) and immediately makes the agent visible to other teams. Unpublishing flips it back to team-only and automatically removes every subscription that pointed at the agent so other teams stop seeing its activity going forward; previously delivered timeline posts and activity feed entries are preserved.
- Each team now has a `public_agent_limit` (default 1) that caps how many of the team's agents can be published at the same time. Operators can raise or lower this quota for any team via the new `scripts/admin_set_public_agent_limit.py` tool.

## Improvements

- Refreshed dependencies via `uv sync --upgrade`.

# Release v1.2.0

## New Features

- Added Xiaomi's MiMo Token Plan as a built-in LLM provider. Operators with a MiMo subscription can now plug in `MIMO_PLAN_API_KEY` to make the new `mimo-v2.5-pro` and `mimo-v2.5` models available to agents directly, without going through OpenRouter.

## Breaking Changes

- The MiniMax provider environment variable was renamed from `MINIMAX_API_KEY` to `MINIMAX_PLAN_API_KEY` to reflect that the integration uses the MiniMax subscription plan. Deployments that referenced the old name need to update their configuration; there is no automatic fallback.

# Release v1.1.0

## New Features

- WeChat agents now proactively reach out before their reply window closes. WeChat only lets a bot push messages within a day of the user's last inbound message; once that window expires, scheduled posts and other proactive notifications stop arriving. About 30 minutes before the window closes, the agent now sends a friendly heads-up that prompts the user to reply with any message (or assign a new task) to keep the channel open, and folds in a quick status summary of the team's agents and any pending autonomous tasks.

# Release v1.0.0

## New Features

- WeChat agents now accept voice, video, and file messages in addition to images. Users can send an audio note, a short video, or a document and the agent will receive the content directly instead of a "type not supported" fallback.

## Improvements

- Expanded the catalog of selectable LLM models — the latest DeepSeek, Claude Opus, Kimi, and MiMo releases are now available when configuring agents.
- When an agent's underlying model returns an empty response (for example, Gemini rejecting a malformed tool call), the conversation thread now recovers automatically instead of becoming stuck. The offending turn is cleaned up, and internal logs capture the surrounding tool-call history so engineers can diagnose the cause.

## Other

- Refreshed internal dependencies across the Python backend and Go integrations.

# Release v0.18.0

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/crestalnetwork/intentkit/compare/v0.17.60...v0.18.0

# Release v0.17.60

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed a long-standing issue where images sent through WeChat came through as unreadable garbage and the AI refused to process them. Inbound images now decrypt correctly, so users can share photos with their agents and get a real response.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/crestalnetwork/intentkit/compare/v0.17.59...v0.17.60

# Release v0.17.59

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where images sent through WeChat could be stored incorrectly and cause the AI to reject them, with the error then blocking any further messages in the same conversation. Inbound images are now validated before being forwarded to the AI, and unrecognized or unsupported formats are dropped cleanly instead of poisoning the conversation.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/crestalnetwork/intentkit/compare/v0.17.58...v0.17.59

# Release v0.17.58

## Improvements

- Improved reliability for agents with large skill catalogs. Built-in capabilities — current time, long-term memory, posts, activities, and sub-agent calls — now remain available even when the automatic tool-selection layer narrows the active tool set. Previously these core tools could be filtered out, causing agents to repeatedly attempt the same failed call without recovering.
- Raised the threshold at which the automatic tool-selection layer activates and refined the counting logic so built-in provider tools no longer push borderline agents into the selection path prematurely.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/crestalnetwork/intentkit/compare/v0.17.57...v0.17.58

# Release v0.17.57

## New Features

- Added time-limited **share links** for chats and posts. Team members can now generate a public URL that lets anyone — including recipients without an account — view a chat transcript or post for three days.
- When posts are delivered to WeChat or Telegram, the push message now contains a share link instead of a login-gated URL, so off-platform recipients can open the content directly.

## Improvements

- Each public view increments a view counter on the share link, and creator metadata (user and team) is retained for future reporting.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/crestalnetwork/intentkit/compare/v0.17.56...v0.17.57

# Release v0.17.56

## Improvements

- Tuned the threshold at which the automatic tool-selection layer activates, so agents with mid-sized skill sets now run without the extra selection step and only agents with larger skill catalogs trigger it.
- Routine dependency updates.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/crestalnetwork/intentkit/compare/v0.17.55...v0.17.56

# Release v0.17.55

## Improvements

- Added diagnostic logging that records which image URLs are forwarded to the model, making it easier to investigate image-processing errors in production.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/crestalnetwork/intentkit/compare/v0.17.54...v0.17.55

# Release v0.17.54

## Improvements

- Silenced noisy Gemini-related warning logs (schema compatibility and automatic function calling notices) that were flooding production logs without adding operational value.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/crestalnetwork/intentkit/compare/v0.17.53...v0.17.54

# Release v0.17.53

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed several issues in the WeChat integration that prevented inbound images from reaching the LLM and caused spurious "push failed" alerts even when messages were successfully delivered.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/crestalnetwork/intentkit/compare/v0.17.52...v0.17.53

# Release v0.17.52

## New Features

- **Alert forwarding for Go integrations**: The Telegram and WeChat integration services now automatically forward error-level events to the configured alert channel (Telegram or Slack), matching the behavior already in place on the Python side. Both stacks share the same per-minute alert budget so operators are not flooded.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/crestalnetwork/intentkit/compare/v0.17.51...v0.17.52

# Release v0.17.51

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where error-level events were not being forwarded to the configured alert channel (Telegram/Slack). Operators will once again receive automatic notifications when errors occur.

## Other

- Updated dependencies.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/crestalnetwork/intentkit/compare/v0.17.50...v0.17.51

# Release v0.17.50

## New Features

- **WeChat image storage**: Images received from WeChat are now downloaded, decrypted, and stored on S3, providing stable URLs that the AI model can reliably access. Previously, WeChat's temporary CDN links could expire before the model processed them.

- **Cross-turn media forwarding**: The lead agent can now forward images, videos, and files to sub-agents even when the media was received in a previous message. Attachment URLs are made visible to the lead so it can reference them across conversation turns.

## Other

- Updated dependencies.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/crestalnetwork/intentkit/compare/v0.17.49...v0.17.50

# Release v0.17.49

## New Features

- **Media input support for LLM models**: Added audio, video, and file input support fields to model configuration, enabling richer media input options when selecting models.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed markdown rendering on post pages — headings and other typography styles were not displaying correctly.

## Other

- Updated dependencies.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/crestalnetwork/intentkit/compare/v0.17.48...v0.17.49

# Release v0.17.48

## New Features

- **WeChat image support**: Agents can now receive and process images sent by users through WeChat. Images are extracted from incoming messages and passed to the agent's model for understanding.

## Improvements

- Improved error handling when users send images to agents using models that don't support image input — a clear message is now returned instead of a silent failure.
- Simplified image capability detection for agents by removing the deprecated image parser skill fallback.
- Optimized agent delegation to avoid unnecessary database queries when forwarding attachments between agents.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/crestalnetwork/intentkit/compare/v0.17.47...v0.17.48

# Release v0.17.47

## Bug Fixes

- Paid x402 actions now fail gracefully in agent conversations instead of surfacing as internal server errors when wallet funding or payment setup runs into trouble.

## Improvements

- Improved Safe wallet x402 payment reliability with clearer timeout handling.
- Added automatic administrator alerts when the x402 paymaster runs out of gas, so platform issues can be addressed faster.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/crestalnetwork/intentkit/compare/v0.17.46...v0.17.47

# Release v0.17.46

## Improvements

- Chat conversations now continue running on the server when you navigate to other pages — only the explicit Cancel button stops generation. Returning to the thread shows the latest messages, including ones produced while you were away.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/crestalnetwork/intentkit/compare/v0.17.45...v0.17.46

# Release v0.17.45

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed a critical issue where autonomous (scheduled) tasks failed to run when payment was enabled — autonomous triggers now correctly bill the agent's team, matching the behavior of other platform channels.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/crestalnetwork/intentkit/compare/v0.17.44...v0.17.45

# Release v0.17.44

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed OpenRouter-based image generation for both auto-generated agent/team avatars and image skills — generation now succeeds reliably.

## Improvements

- Migrated the OpenRouter integration to the official OpenRouter Python SDK for better retry handling and type safety.
- Traffic going through OpenRouter is now attributed to IntentKit in the OpenRouter dashboard (previously attributed to LangChain).
- Added cost reconciliation logging so OpenRouter-reported costs can be compared against internal token-based billing.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/crestalnetwork/intentkit/compare/v0.17.43...v0.17.44

# Release v0.17.43

## New Features

- Added a team avatar generation API that lets user and team profiles create AI-generated avatars from a text prompt, with usage billed through a new direct media billing path.

## Improvements

- Improved WeChat integration reliability — media uploads to the WeChat CDN now retry automatically on transient failures.
- Internal refresh of the Go integration documentation and dependency upgrades.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/crestalnetwork/intentkit/compare/v0.17.42...v0.17.43

# Release v0.17.42

## New Features

- Sub-agent calls (via `call_agent`) now surface attachments (images, files, etc.) from the sub-agent back to the calling agent.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed a critical issue in the skill pricing module where skill calls were not being charged their declared per-skill price.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/crestalnetwork/intentkit/compare/v0.17.41...v0.17.42

# Release v0.17.41

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where sub-agent calls (via `call_agent`) reused the same conversation thread across invocations, causing stale message history to interfere with new skill configurations. Sub-agent calls are now stateless — each call gets a fresh conversation context.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/crestalnetwork/intentkit/compare/v0.17.40...v0.17.41

# Release v0.17.40

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed WeChat image sending — images now display correctly instead of falling back to text links
- Rewrote WeChat CDN upload protocol to correctly implement the iLink API specification (client-side encryption key generation, proper upload flow, correct message format)

- Fixed Pydantic model field defaults to be compatible with static type checkers

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed a model name typo

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/crestalnetwork/intentkit/compare/v0.17.37...v0.17.38

---

# Release v0.17.37

## New Features

- **Skill Validation for Agent Creation**: The agent manager now validates skill configurations when creating new agents, ensuring only valid skills can be assigned. Invalid skill names or formats are rejected with clear error messages.
- **Enhanced Skill Listing**: The available skills listing now shows individual skill names and descriptions under each category, making it easier for the agent manager to select the right skills.
- **Improved Agent Manager Prompt**: The agent manager now includes a detailed skill configuration format with concrete examples, guiding it to always check available skills before configuring an agent.

## Improvements

- Unified lead agent endpoints for all channel types (Telegram, WeChat, etc.)
- Stale skills (removed from codebase) are now automatically cleaned up when agents are updated

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed Telegram lead agent verification code and auto-bind
- Fixed skill message attachments not dispatching correctly to WeChat and Telegram

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed a startup crash in public agents sync caused by accessing database objects after the session was closed.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/crestalnetwork/intentkit/compare/v0.17.35...v0.17.36

---

# Release v0.17.35

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where the lead agent could not delegate tasks to team agents via WeChat and Telegram channels. The agent routing was using an incorrect identifier, causing sub-agent calls to always fail from these channels.
- Added a safety mechanism to prevent Gemini 3 model calls from failing with "empty parts" errors due to corrupted conversation history.

## Improvements

- Public agent sync now uses slug-based matching for more reliable updates, and supports tags and archive status.
- Cleaned up Team API endpoint organization for better consistency.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/crestalnetwork/intentkit/compare/v0.17.34...v0.17.35

---

# Release v0.17.34

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where public agents could not be accessed for chat or content viewing through the Team API. Chat history, messages, activities, and posts for public agents were inaccessible to users outside the agent's owning team.

## Improvements

- Improved chat data isolation so that teams can only view and interact with their own conversations on public agents.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/crestalnetwork/intentkit/compare/v0.17.33...v0.17.34

---

# Release v0.17.33

## Bug Fixes

- Markdown images in chat messages are now constrained to a reasonable max height (320px) instead of rendering at full size.
- Image attachment thumbnail hover overlay now matches the actual image bounds for portrait/narrow images instead of extending beyond the image area.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/crestalnetwork/intentkit/compare/v0.17.32...v0.17.33

---

# Release v0.17.32

## Bug Fixes

- Gemini image and Veo video skills now respect Vertex AI configuration (`GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`), fixing failures when using Vertex AI credentials instead of a direct API key.
- LLM tool selector middleware now uses a dedicated model picker (`pick_tool_selector_model`) restricted to OpenAI, avoiding structured-output incompatibilities with Gemini and GLM that caused tool selection to fail silently or return descriptions instead of tool names (see langchain-ai/langchain#33651).
- Tool selector activation threshold raised from 10 to 15 tools, reducing unnecessary overhead for agents with moderate tool counts.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/crestalnetwork/intentkit/compare/v0.17.31...v0.17.32

---

# Release v0.17.31

## Bug Fixes

- Public agent pages can now be opened directly from the Discover page again, for both signed-in members of other teams and anonymous visitors.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/crestalnetwork/intentkit/compare/v0.17.30...v0.17.31

---

# Release v0.17.30

## New Features

- Activity push notifications on WeChat and Telegram now include a direct link back to the original post, so recipients can jump straight to the source.

## Improvements

- The team lead agent has a clearer role definition and a refined decision-making workflow, helping it more reliably choose between answering directly, delegating to a built-in helper, calling an existing team agent, or creating a new specialized agent when needed.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/crestalnetwork/intentkit/compare/v0.17.29...v0.17.30

---

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/crestalnetwork/intentkit/compare/v0.17.3...v0.17.4

---

# Release v0.17.2

## New Features

### Telegram Channel Verification System
- Team Telegram channels now require verification before chats can interact with the bot. When a bot is connected, a 4-digit verification code is generated. New private chats or group conversations must send this code to activate. The code automatically regenerates after each successful verification for security.

### Telegram Bot Status Monitoring
- The Channels page now shows real-time bot listening status (Listening / Connecting / Error), bot username, and a list of all verified chats. Admins can remove verified chats directly from the UI.

### Verification Rate Limiting
- To prevent brute-force attempts, verification is limited to 3 attempts per chat within a 10-minute window.

## Improvements
- Minor gitignore improvements.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/crestalnetwork/intentkit/compare/v0.17.1...v0.17.2

---

# Release v0.17.1

### Discover Page & Public Agents
- **30 curated public agents** are now available out of the box, covering content creation (Blog Writer, Email Copywriter, SEO Optimizer), research (Market Researcher, Academic Researcher, Fact Checker), education (Study Tutor, Language Coach), productivity (Resume Coach, Business Plan Writer, Meeting Minutes), health (Nutrition Planner, Fitness Coach), and more.
- **Discover page** with three tabs — Agents, Timeline, and Posts — lets users explore all public agents and their content in one place.
- **Subscribe to public agents** directly from the agent detail page. Subscribed agents appear in your Timeline and Posts, and your agents can call them as sub-agents.

### Permission-Aware Agent Detail Pages
- Agent detail pages now show or hide Edit, Archive, and task management controls based on ownership. Public agents you don't own display a "Public" badge and a Subscribe button instead.

### Public Feed System
- Activities and posts from public agents are automatically distributed to a shared public feed, powering the Discover page's Timeline and Posts tabs.

### Smart Agent Sync
- Public agents are automatically synced from configuration files on startup. If a required AI model is not available in the current deployment, the agent is gracefully archived and automatically restored when the model becomes available.

## Improvements
- Improved local agent list to only show your own agents, keeping the interface clean.
- Feed fan-out logic refactored for better maintainability.

## API Changes
- New public endpoints: `GET /public/agents`, `GET /public/timeline`, `GET /public/posts`, `GET /public/posts/{post_id}`
- New subscription endpoints: `POST /subscriptions/{agent_id}`, `DELETE /subscriptions/{agent_id}`, `GET /subscriptions`

## Improvements

- Improved frontend development hot reload support in Docker.

# Release v0.16.5

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed full-width digit rendering in PDF generation when using CJK fonts.

# Release v0.16.4

## New Features

- **PDF Download for Posts**: Posts can now be downloaded as professionally styled PDF files directly from the browser. The backend generates high-quality PDFs with full support for CJK characters and emoji.
